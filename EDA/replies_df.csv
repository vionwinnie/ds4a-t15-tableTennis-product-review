0,5f686bc7b59794ca78c70902,Tenergy 05FX vs Tenergy 64FX,"Hi stao, the response of the T64fx changes depending on the the blade you're using. Usually I have a Primorac Carbon and I'm offensive player with agressive top spin. I used T05fx before and I really appreciate the general feeling of the T64fx, which is more softer but faster than 05fx. On the other hand less spin too. Very good for block. For my style I really prefer T64fx than T05fx ( always 2.1 for me).I bought recently the complete Garaydia family to see if from the blade I had a possibility to improve my skills and I would say no.With the ALC it is too soft and slow for me, with the T5000 too fast and the ZLC has a softer touch and could be an alternative. I'm truly amazed about the huge difference between those 3 blades.To finish I'm currently glueing a Dignics 05 on my Primorac carbon to test as the season ended. after a training I'll see if it fits for me or if I have to test it with the garaydia T5000 or Garaydia ZLC as I'm seeking more spin..."

2,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,maybe TTD can start reviewing some sp rubbers?
3,5f686bc8b59794ca78c70903,Butterfly Impartial XS vs 802-40 vs spinlord waran2,"I do not know if tabletennisdaily can reiview short pips. Think they need someone that know how to play with them. I think all three of them are considered grippy short pips so you can create some spin but there are less effect and deception. 802 40 is not a rubber with inbuilt glue effect, think the two other are. So the two latter is proably a bit faster? I also think 802 40 is hardest, or atleast feel the the most hard. Try google and you will find alot. Or ask at oaak tabletennis forum. They know more about pimples than guys here. How do you want to play and use your short pimple? Short pimple can be pretty different. Some good for one style and some better for another."

I suppose it is ok on CPen or as Forhand rubber.802-40 is very balanced but still feels a litle hard on touch shots,I suggest you to conisder Tutle Summer 3C it feels as upgraded 802-40- it is most balanced short pips i have ever tried."
5,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,"apolonia weight more, u can find between 85-90 gramsIF ZLC- 80-85I find Apolonia is more flexy and have softer outer ply and I love itand I think has better quality than IF ZLC too I find something special in Apolonia and this is the best blade right now if money is not the problem"
6,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,thanks Konrad. Is the apalonia faster then the Innerforce?
7,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,Apolonia is also innerforce...
8,5f686bcdb59794ca78c70905,What is the difference between Apalonia ZLC vs Innerforce ZLC,If you want to save money.I think DHS fang bo ALC or DHS H301 is a good choices for you that It is the same innerforce with different outer ply Limba for fang bo and Koto for H301.

11,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,I'm not sure about that. I think T25FX is better than T64 for blocking and short game. I don't know anything about the T80 though.
12,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Lifehack: buy T05 first, then once it wears out, buy T80, or vice versa. This way you will learn by yourself how these rubbers play for you. And the difference between them is not that big so you can go from one to another with a minimal adjustment."
13,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Depend on your skill. I like hard sponge so t05 is my favorite.
14,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"The sponge on T05, T80, T64 and T25 is all the same. The difference is not the sponge. It is the pimple construction. T64 has longer thinner pimples with more space between pimples so the pips give more and the rubber feels softer. T05 pimples are a little shorter, thicker, and closer together so the rubber feels harder. But even the rubber in the topsheet is the same. Just the pimple construction is different. To the OP, I would like to ask what he means by the word ""best"". I won't comment on T25; but T05, T80 and T64 are all great rubbers. There are people whose game and style of play may work with one of them slightly better than the others. But they are all really great rubbers. There is a video that explains decently what the difference between each one is. Once I am able to search for it, I will post it here. But it has been posted to the forum many times already. That video should help you out a decent amount. To sum the info up simply:1) T05: Slower, More Spin, Higher Throw Angle. 2) T64: Faster, Less Spin, Lower Throw Angle. 3) T80: half way between T05 and T64. So do you want a bigger arc, more spin to spin the person off the table but a little sacrifice in speed? Or do you want lower shots that don't come up as much and are faster. But with an amount of spin that is easier to counter. Or do you want to be half way in between the two extremes?I go with slower and more spin every time. Especially since T05 is more than fast enough. Sent from Deep Space by Abacus"

16,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Most people, including Butterfly reps, discuss T25 and T25FX as rubbers that are specialized Tenergies. Most discussion is about T05, T64 and T80 as those are similar rubbers along a continuum."
17,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"With the term best, I mean actually the best experience with these rubbers. The video mentioned I was actually familiar with. But it doesn't give much information about the touch of these series at the table. Tabletennis is not only about spinny topspin. For example how does each individual rubber reacts to spinny serves? I found that t05 is very sensitive to incoming spin and spinny serves. But T80 is less sensitive to it etc. Verstuurd vanaf mijn SM-G900F met Tapatalk"
18,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"T25 is also a very-very good rubber, just a way different than other Tenergies and suits less people. T80 has a little bit more control (for me), less sensitive to spin, but T05 is spinnier."
19,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Yes, but that is if you are into passive returns. If you like to push and spin aggressively, the T05 reaction is a benefit. It's when you try to just touch the serve without any acceleration that using T05 is a nightmare."
20,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"And that term best is still about preference and each person will feel something slightly different is ""best"". Like, for me, hands down, I like T05 more than the others for forehand. For backhand T05, T64 and T05FX have all worked fine. If I used it T80 may be fine as well. But I remember when I tried it, I didn't try for that long and was used to T05FX and didn't give it much of a chance. The extra spin and higher throw seems to be more important to my forehand than my backhand. Sent from Deep Space by Abacus"

22,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Trial and error. Results may vary. 05 64 and 80 all good. Will depend a lot on blade.
23,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Hi all, I've used T05 for a short time 7 years ago, too hard for me, then T05fx when it arrived in the market, a bit better but still hard even ewwith the softer sponge, surely due to the pimp construction, so the hardness of the sponge change not so much the ""feeling"" for me, then I switched to T64fx which is a great one in my opinion based on my play and my strokes. After testing Dignics 05 on a zlc blade after the end of last season I'm back to my primorac carbon this time with T80fx, that's a better combination for me as it gives me what I was looking for, so a bit more spin and control than T64fx. That's clear the complete Tenergy family and now the Dignics are great rubbers, but depending on your play not all of them would fit perfectly with you."
24,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,Very strange to see a post I wrote 4 years ago being quoted out of nowhere. Is there any particular reason you woke this old thread up?
25,5f686bdbb59794ca78c7090b,Tenergy 05 vs Tenergy 80,"Yes, I was looking in the Tenergy family what's fitting the best with me. Maybe this tread is old but what´s said is still actual. If I started to change my 64fx for 80fx and test them I had found my solution easily and by the way, saved a lot of money instead of buying 3 Garaydia and 2 sets of Dignics...."
26,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"The more old, the more soft the blade becomes and this is why people tends to have far better feeling with old viscarias because its.........softer than new ones. All Black tags are ""old"" today. Not mentionning that water based glue soften the wood also.Also there is a huge difference between two ZJK, just like there is between two viscarias or two TBS. I own two ZJK (blue dragon), one is just like my viscaria (new tag), the other is much much more powerfull, faster, larger sweet sport and to me a much better feeling also......despite being lighter than my other alc blades.....I will swtich to this one for the plastic ball maybe. Two wood pieces are never exactly the same. You might try a new viscaria, like it, and you might dislike the viscaria you will actually by......New viscaria/tbs/tbalc/Zjk/Zjkalc....the name doesn't matters here, any of those blade can feel like the Zjk you tried, any of those blade can feel like your present TBalc and any of those blade might feel even better than you TBalc.......but if you buy it new, there is no chance it will feed like the old viscaria you tried."

30,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"this is all so true, i recently in the past 8 months have bought 3 viscaria's. all 3 from butterflyonlinefirst one was really powerfulsecond one was flexy3rd was some where in betweenalso i bought a Timoboll ALC and it was so powerful and fast i didn't match what the viscaria's felt like.anyway... i sold all my butterfly blades and switched to stiga clippers woodsthe main reason is the butterfly handles are all too small, and thin. stiga handles are superior and the clipper has such a sweet feel and power ratio plus the weight of the clipper is what the poly ball is requiring IMHO.so yes.. even at the highest level maker of blades, in this case butterfly, all 3 of my viscaria's felt different and i am very critical of my equipment. btw i play in the usa and my rating is some where around 2130 - 2180 - just if you are wondering what level i play at."
31,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I will one day sell the Phamster on the idea of filling in his hollowed handle Clipper to upgrade it to moar Beast Mode.
32,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"Der_Echte, I would love to see you playing with a Clipper with your modification done to it. That would be great. I would love to try the blade too. I have one Clipper I could do it to, but, it is a bit too light so it doesn't really play like a REAL Clipper. It is only 91 grams and the one I used to have that was 95 grams was sooooo much better. If we filled the handle on that one it would play amazing. 95 grams is a good weight for a blade. Then if you have a Clipper that is 95 grams and you add 10 grams to the handle so it is handle heavy and weighs 105, that would play like a beast."

36,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I even have C clamps for clamping when gluing the handle back on.
37,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,"I though that is why Carl was given two rows of teeth...I sometimes use a clamp, sometimes, just hold it in hand until it sets good enough then wrap grip tape over it and call it a day until it is set by the next day.One time in Korea, I did this mod to one of the 896 Carl tried out and I played it 1 hr after I glued it back together, I used grip tape, it might be the one with Sigma Euro and H3..."
38,5f686c26b59794ca78c70938,New Viscaria vs Old Viscaria,I bet leaving it clamped for a day would make it so you can glue it back perfectly and not be able to feel that it was taken apart.

40,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,Yes tenergy 80 had more control but that's just a matter of getting used to your rubber and knowing how it works and yes it might be more forgiving too. Tenergy 64 still has a lot of spin just not as much as 80 and 80 is was better with flicks Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
41,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,So if you like to win points of the serve you probably won't be that far back so I would go with tenergy 80 besides I don't like 64 as a backhand rubber anyway for me I would use it as a forehand rubber!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
42,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I would say that t80 is very fast. Too fast for me for BH especially with OFF blade. I would suggest t05fx, it is softer more control and less speed, but still not slow."
43,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I would say, play against any noob, and you can win your point off the serve.But if you are going to be serious and play against people that knows how to return your serves, 3rd balls, and so on, then its more your style of play + skills/techinque + rubber.By the sound of the above ""wishlist"" from you, your equipment is an overkillThe 2 rubbers you suggested is all good for serve, chopping, rallies etc.T80 is more suited maybe for close to the table, while T64 can go further back.Other than that, it is really little difference for any player that is not ranked in the top level (in the top level, a 1% difference is a matter about winning and loosing)"
44,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"It is not only that. A lot of people like tenergy rubbers, especially those who played long time ago with Srivers boostes with a glue each training session. The problem is that some blades which are very offensive makes the set up with tenergies not easy to control. What I mean is the problem with short push, service return and short spinny topspins. Nowadays tactics are focused on playing short only with BH side, so we can say FH rubber can be very aggresive to make powerful and spinny topspin, while BH side should be more allround to be able playing pushes etc. T05FX is much easier to control and if you take it with 1.9mm, it is great for everything.I wouldn't say that T80 is good for playing close. if you want to play close T05 if much better. T80 with different dimension of pips makes the ball going higher so it is much better to play further then T05, but I cannot compare it to T64 because I have never try it."
45,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,T64 has MUCH more spin than T80…
46,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,why not tenergy 05 ?
47,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,So what would the best rubber be for the BH?And is Tenergy 05 a good choice for a FH Rubber?Thank You everyone so far for your help.
48,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I think, just go T05 on both sides.Timo Boll agrees btw "

51,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"I was going to say, start from Timo Boll All and work the way up.Otherwise I can always recommened the Timo Boll Spirit, since Mr Boll is using that with T05 on both sides, i'm sure Jak can end up in the world top 10 too with the exact same equipment.Jak, how long are you in table tennis?Sounds to me you are looking at a way overkill equipment.IMO, get a 2x rubbers + 1x blade at less than a price of those blades you have in question, and I'm sure that will be better for you. Unless you think most expensive is the best, or fastest is the best, or spinnest is the best etc.FZD stated that he doesn't like fast, he prefers more control equipment.

53,5f686c4cb59794ca78c70952,Tenergy 64 vs 80 On BH,"It seems your step is too big. Your current set up is quite strange. Most of people start with allround blade and then upgrade only the rubbers to faster. Final change to OFF blade is only for really advanced players, when they lack of speed with allround blade and off rubbers. If you want to change everything I would suggest to choose OFF- setup. For instance blade Primorac JP OFF-, very good blade or Tibhar Stratus Powerwood. They are both OFF- blades but Tibhar is little bit faster. As to the rubbers if you want to choose Butterfly, you can take T05FX to your BH (you can trust me, it is the best choice from the Bty offer) and then it depends how do you play with you FH, if you play close you can take T05, if you like to play in distance you can take T80."

Baracuda is not as heavy, but in my opinion, just as good.Tenergy 05 reacts quite a bit to topspin, although if you have an ALL blade, it should be fine.

61,5f686de56da47ec32a42ce9f,Tenenergy 05 vs Donic Baracuda,"Tenergy and Baracuda are actually remarkably quite similar, despite the $25 difference per sheet.Tenergy has a slightly higher throw angle than Baracuda, so looping heavy chops may be a little bit easier, with a greater arc on the ball. However, Baracuda still has a medium-high throw so they're both perfectly fine for looping. In my personal opinion, Baracuda has more spin than Tenergy, however it lacks a little bit of power and control compared to Ten.Tenergy often has many complaints of it being incredibly heavy per sheet, but many reviews say it is worth it. Ultimately, with a heavier top-sheet comes more power, but you can adjust this with your sponge layer. Baracuda is not as heavy, but in my opinion, just as good.Tenergy 05 reacts quite a bit to topspin, although if you have an ALL blade, it should be fine. Baracuda is very good with incoming spin, and would be fine with any blade. Just remember to keep your bat angle low. Tenergy has many complaints of it being non-durable. Some reviewers claim that with only a few days of playing with it, obvious cracks were in the rubber on the side. However, I've had my Tenergy 64 for about a few months now and it's looking fine. Just don't throw it around on the table. Baracuda has never had complaints about it breaking easily, so Donic wins this one. Maybe because the topsheet is a little bit harder.I can't really comment how easy either one is to use, since they're suited for different playing styles. Tenergy is noticeably faster than Baracuda, though not quite as spinny. If driving's your thing, use Tenergy. If long, spinny rallies is how you tend to lean towards, Baracuda would be a better rubber. They're both very good rubbers in my opinion, though I would use Baracuda over Tenergy, because it is closer to my style of play.In conclusion, Ten has higher throw angleTen is heavier Ten is more sensitive to incoming topspin, though can be adjusted with blade or sponge layerBara is much more durable (according to reviewers)I also personally think that Baracuda is a much better rubber in terms of worth for money.

66,5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani, You will be able to see the difference between 2.1 and 1.9 if you compare the bats side-by-side. Or you can use a ruler.
67,5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,Anyone ever compared the weight in a scale for Tenergy 1.9 and 2.1?

69,5f686df56da47ec32a42ceaa,Tenergy (1.9 vs 2.1 weight) on Timo Boll ALC and Jun Mizutani,"Nice link you got there. Easy to search and compares all other rubbers too.So it seems that...Tenergy64 (2.1) = 67g to 68gTenergy64 (1.9) = 63gTenergy05(2.1) = 70gTenergy05(1.9) = 66g to 68gThere is about 4g different for 2.1 and 1.9 sheet uncut rubber. So after cutting it out, I assume, the difference would probably be 3g then.3g for both side is equal to 6g.I suppose 6g makes a SIGNIFICANT difference for smaller sized guy like me."

72,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,Fxp is more of a direct sponge compression type of contact. Elp would be better if you brush
73,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,Thanks!
74,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,FX-P has a grippier topsheet and softer sponge than EL-P and is comparable to the Tenergy FX series. I personally felt EL-P was better for blocking and FX-P for looping. EL-P felt a little too passive.
75,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,and i'm in square one again probably I will choose el-p as it's quite a bit cheaper in a place when I'm going to buy that rubber from.
76,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,"I haven't tried fx-p but used el-p on backhand for a couple of years. It worked perfectly on a Off- allwood blade, but when I changed to a off- 5+2 blade with carbon/kevlar next to the inner ply, I had some problems with it. In those soft/slow topspin hits it gripped the ball very inconsistently. Sometimes it would behave normally as before and sometimes it would throw very high. So it depends on how flexible your blade is. From the description of the fx-p(it should be closer to mx-p, just softer), I don't think it will have the same problem on a stiffer blade."
77,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,"I'm not surprised, felt the same thing."
78,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,"Sorry. If it's a quite a bit cheaper, get EL-P, it's by all means a good BH rubber."
79,5f686f47a1e880dd66b5fdda,Tibhar Evo EL-P vs FX-P for flicks and brushing loops,I play on 5ply all wood blade (dhs pg3). Thanks all for your help.
80,5f686f49a1e880dd66b5fddb,"EL-P vs EL-S, Any Experiences, Please share","EL-S is heavier and feels a lot harder, even though the numbers (sponge hardness) are not that different. Requires a better brushing contact and is less forgiving."

Way more linear than other BH rubbers that I've tried such as T05-FX, FX-P and Genesis M. You get back what you put in."
85,5f686f49a1e880dd66b5fddb,"EL-P vs EL-S, Any Experiences, Please share",EL-S would be more suitable for people who.prefer more control and spin.
86,5f686f51a1e880dd66b5fde0,FX-P vs FX-S,FX-P is softer and has more catapult.Everything else is pretty much on the same level.

89,5f68727510fb22f7fce1f881,Stiga genesis m vs mantra m on bh,Depend on how good your BH is. Mantra M is supposed to be easier to handle. I have it on one of my blades for the moment and must say it is very controllable. Not particularly spinny though. Genesis is probably spinner but that may affect the control.
90,5f68727510fb22f7fce1f881,Stiga genesis m vs mantra m on bh,"I've used Mantra S on the BH, I prefer softer on the BH. It's very spinny. Nice rubber."

It does not have the Catapult effect but i can loop an underspin serve easily and the soft sponge gives you enough dwell time and it quite forgivingSent from my SM-A700H using Tapatalk
92,5f68727510fb22f7fce1f881,Stiga genesis m vs mantra m on bh,"Mantra is a Japanese rubber to rival tenergy and might just go out of production over time, supply is low in Europe, don´t know whether Stiga will continue to distribute it elsewhere.Genesis is a hybrid rubber which pretty much plays like a Chinese rubber, sticky surface but very little catapult to support strokes, it must be played more actively than Mantra.So, the question is not which one will give you more spin but which kind of rubber do you prefer?Changing between different types can be demanding."
93,5f68727510fb22f7fce1f881,Stiga genesis m vs mantra m on bh,Genesis m is spinny and very durable. Its really difficult to cut. Never tried mantra
94,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05,TTDB/Revspin is bull?
95,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05,"German made rubbers like Gold Arc 8 have gone through a lot of development progress to finally arrive at a point where some equal t05 in spin potential. t05 being less spinny than GA 8 seems a bit unlikely to me, having tried both. I liked GA 8, but I thought it was a bit like Donic bluefire M1. However, you might find it easier to generate spin with GA 8, while t05 has a higher maximum that not everybody can activate."
96,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05,"Well considering the possible difference in skill and technique, and the fact that anyone can rate, its kind of hard to really be 100% reliable. In reality its would much easier to start comparing rubbers and blades: Robots playing with Robots in an isolated environment. But manufacturers probably don't want that kind of transparency."
97,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05,"I have played with both. There are two GA8s, 47.5° and 50°, in two thicknesses, 2.0 and 2.2mm, and in two colors, red and black. Red and black felt the same to me. The thickness differences had the predictable effect. However, hardness did matter. At 50°, things clicked for me; at 47.5° it played, for me, much like a wide range of the (upper echelon of) ESN rubbers. I don't think I would be able to distinguish it from Vega X.I prefer GA8/50 to T05, but still give T05 a distinct edge in spin creation. At the high end both were close, but below that T05 created more spin more easily. That advantage, for me, was more than compensated by GA8/50s handling in the short game, blocks, counters."
98,5f68727810fb22f7fce1f883,Gold arc 8 vs tenergy 05,Were those in the same condition? Both top sheet and sponge deteriorates over time.

100,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"I've tried O7P but not DNA. O7P is definitely a solid rubber, it has that 'click' feeling when you hit which is awesome. However O7P is a little bit lacking in grip if compared to tenergy or Rasanter. This is why I'm a little bit hesitant."
101,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"Really? I found Omega 7 to be one of the few with more grip than tenergy...If that's the case, stay away from DNA.Although I do find the Pro topsheet a bit too soft, the DNA plays more direct. If you want more grip, you might have to go tacky. Tibhar Hybrid K1 is excellent stuff."
102,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,that lack of grip is good for not sensitive to spin so u can counter easier dna idk at all

Control, feel and speed are all fine. But spin is quite lacking compared to other rubbers at the same price range.However, O7P is awesome if you want a rubber not too sensitive to incoming spin."
104,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"You have to dig through the sponge in order to get spin. The O7P is the opposite of O7A where even by just a thin brush, the O7A is spinny."

113,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,I see.. Thank you for your insight 
114,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"I believe firmly that it is important to know what category and softness/firmness of sponge you need to play the kind of shots a player does given his/her impact.O7P could be great for a player on BH, and I would play much better (hit faster, spinier shots) with a slower control rubber that is kinda on the soft side. Last tourney I had unboosted/unglued Nittaku Hammond (the old school inverted rubber) in 2.0 on BH and was simply a beast of BH the last tourney. I could give my bat and rubber to another player my levels and that player may so hate on the entire bat.It comes down to how you make impact and what shots you are trying to do, then knowing what is more suitable.it is next to impossible to say that without having been around a player and be on the other side as the player tries different rubbers on same blade and you feel and see what that player is doing.It isn't so cut and dried as asking if this rubber is ""better"" for FH or BH.Watch Dan and Tom as they do video reviews of equipment.ALWAYS it is a DYNAMIC test of the shots they do with their kind of impacts."
115,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"Man he can put every rubber on different blade and take 2-3 days to know how equipment work this is dynamic test ? no pressure and you can play whatever you want with superstar just to show how well rubber is working on 20 minutes video. If someone have in his signature Rasanter 47 what kind of rubber will be better for him? I don't like answers what is better blade , rubber whatever because everything works different with different place. I like playing in small gym so I have different vision than guy who was in the big hall and have more feeling with the bigger places.Next. I put words from yogi bear, and wait for responds. Why you don't write this ""impact"" knowledge "" when famous guy wrote a review and put words like- typical power forehand rubber.Why? Because it's business. So for me DNA pro M is more like Rasanter 47 big brother than OP7 because its not from the same place factory so I know something more than this is better because it's better and that's allXiom Omega 7 Pro is good rubber but I think V Tour is their best work and this is only my word."
116,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"I know my kind of impact (how I strike the ball) and I am not great with a firm sponged dynamic rubber in most shot situations, except for couterlooping medium to fast loops... then I am boss... but have significantly harder time doing the other tasks I do more frequently. That is my FH wing. My BH wing has a lot of variety of shots possible, but at the end of the day, softer dynamic rubbers, or slower older softer rubbers give me more consistency in landing percentage and my power shots on that wing do not lack power or control. I just don't get the same easy spin and control with the modern firmer sponged dynamic rubbers (think Tenergy, O7P)That is a quick summary of my kind of impact that I understand about myself. I am basically a get it into the topsheet gentle-like and accelerate kind impact hitting guy... that means a topsheet with a pimple structure that is easy to bend pips/wrap topsheet around ball and a softer dynamic sponge (or a linear one on low/med end) is my sweet spot.Understanding that about myself helps me select equipment that works for what I do.I think this kind of understanding of self is important.I have tried both O7Tour and DNA Pro M... I did not like either for my general FH... I did not like either for my BH... but that was ME and my opinion about what was suitable for my way of striking the ball. When I am in person with someone in the club, I have them go through several different dynamic shot situations. I see how they open vs underspin slow, how they open fast, how they drive, how they push, how they do topspin to topspin at and away from table, how they block passively and actively. I see and feel what they did. I have them trout several different classes of equipment and rubbers and sponge hardness and can see quickly the improvement or degrade in quality.That is how you I can get someone to realize the class of equipment suitable for them. Just about every maker has one or three of every class and some are equal, some similar, some better or worse.Just because someone has a certain rubber on their sig doesn't mean it is the perfect rubber for them on that wing... if it was, why would the player change it? It is very well know what is similar to Rasanter 47... MX-K is the first rubber to come to mind with similar properties on the low to medium impacts. O7P is in a similar class, but a different rubber altogether. There are so many rubbers and blades out there, it is literally impossible to test them all. If you understand the basic properties of certain blades and the rubbers, you have an idea of how will play and what is suitable for yourself or a certain player. TTD member erm is probably the forums largest EJ and it is not even close - no one is even 10 times as close. That dude used to maintain an ARSENAL of a thousand plus blades... for years. He knows every blade maker of significance in the WORLD. He had the original makers RECREATE Stellan Bengston's old blade and gifted it to Stellan in Calfornia. erm comes to the club daily with a dozen combinations of blades and rubbers and tries them ALL. despite that, he MIGHT have tried 10 percent of all possible combinations over the couple decades since he returned tot he sport.He will tell you the same things I have said about equipment selection and probably say it easier and better than I do. Since so many posts about equipment are fanboy posts or players inquiring about equipment that is obviously not suitable for them, erm had quickly opted to not get involved in discussing equipment. Why would he? Most folk would try to not believe him or get into a pointless argument... when they are .2% qualified to discuss equipment than he is.Maybe I can get him to talk in this thread briefly about the concepts he holds important just to make it a public record for service to TTD members.Stuff like this happens a lot on forums. (Professional TT people come on to talk, and quickly, the USATT 1200 armchair captains try to tell the pro they are wrong and what not) Anyone who used to post on about.com remember when Werner Schlager himself came on the forum to discuss an aspect, and suddenly, he met with a lot of baseless criticism? Then you never heard from him on the forum.KB, I think you make an important point about the play venue... the floor surface, the sub-surface, the altitude, humidity, and the table itself (also the paint condition). They are all large factors and not so many players are aware of that and do not know how (or are just not intuitive enough) to adapt to them. Myself, I was never good enough on my FH impact to use a tour version of any omega series rubber... on BH, even if I could make all the shots, my percentage and quality was simply better with a slower, more control oriented rubber. Until I ran into erm in California, I did not have half my current understanding of how to go about evaluating the different aspects of equipment."

118,5f68729c10fb22f7fce1f898,Need a new BH rubber: O7P vs DNA Pro M?,"Echte is right. There is no such thing as the perfect rubber. In fact, I would go as far as to say there is not too ""much"" difference amongst modern rubbers all together. Knowing the basic properties, which only comes with trying many different rubbers should be enough for you to make a decision.As for basic properties of these 2:The O7P has a noticeably softer topsheet and slightly softer sponge than DNA M. Meanwhile the DNA M has a softer topsheet than older generation ESN rubbers. That should be enough objective information to determine which you would like more.Personally, I prefer the opposite of Der Echte. I lean towards the hardest rubbers (both topsheet and sponge) on hard and stiff blades. Even the lightest hint of ""mushiness"" is a turn off for me. That's why subjective reviews can go either way.As for the OP. Having used both for about a month, objective: springiness, grip, and durability goes to O7P. Subjective: I prefer the DNA because it feels more direct/precise. I also much prefer the O7 Asia and DNA H to their medium versions."

It produces huge spin, but speed-wise you must have excellent forearm acceleration on your loops to get the best out of it. It starts off with high throw but will gradually lower to medium-low. Initially out of the packet, it is very tacky but after my first time cleaning it, it lost most of the tack. If you are a mid-distance looper, this rubber is not for you- it is a monster in the close game but when I take a step back my loops fly into the net because of the low throw. Blocking is good, lands on the table most of the time. If you have any questions, just ask and Ill do my best to answer it."

128,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,Revival!So... anyone between 7 years ago and now have any input on H3 Neo vs. TG2 Neo?My impressions are (TG2 vs. H3) that TG2:-Has lower throw angle and thus smaller margin for error. -Has more Spin potential (especially at harder shots); H3 seems to be generally spinnier in low input shots. -Is a bit slower overall but has a higher ceiling for bottoming out this potentially can be faster/spinnier with the right stroke. -has better feel for me; I can keep my pushes lower and place most shots with more accuracy as long as I’m taking care of the lower throw. Anyone else?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
129,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,"Agree with all your points. At the amateur level many people including myself aren't trained to unleash the top speed/spin of TG2. Therefore I usually played worse with TG2 than with H3. When I just start training with full energy, I train with TG2. My topspin is clearly too much for many club members."
130,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,"So what do you end up playing with now? TG2 or H3?It’s so true, the harder you engage the rubber/sponge, the better it feels and the better the results. Is that a good thing? Teaches me to be aggressive, but I need to find that balance of controlled power. In any case, TG2 is more fun for me to play with than H3. The feeling and almost “specialty” characteristics of it... just kind of cool for me. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
131,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,"I have used both Hurricane 3 NEO and Skyline TG2 NEO, mostly the softest (H39) sponge. H3N tends to go long for me often. TG2 is a little bit slower and better control I think. I actually tried Yinhe Big Dipper and have stuck to this since last autumn. It gives me a little more control than TG2 and still makes my loops vicious. "
132,5f6872e710fb22f7fce1f8af,Skyline TG2 NEO vs Hurricane 3 NEO,I have used all the common DHS rubbers. DHs H3 Neo is my prefered rubber with H2 Neo being second. H2 Neo works well for the BH but right now I have H2 Neo mounted on the FH of my Firewall+ paddles that I use for push blocking. H2 works well enough for close to the table play.

(on a Stiga Offensive Nct CS),"Depending on where you live in Brazil, I find that the high humidity can really mess with Chinese rubbers tackiness. Although I really liked some Chinese rubbers, I find it to give me too much work to keep it clean/dry during training. So, personally, I avoid those for now.I am a bit biased to Donic rubbers and didn’t test the Omega Asia nor DNA, so I cannot give you opinions, but telling what you are using now could help others to help you."

I don’t know if it would fit you, or pair well with your new FH rubber Donic Bluegrip V1.I’m posting this reply here hoping someone else can help you with that.As for my personal opinions, I think that Bluefire M3 is really controllable after the factory booster wears off.

148,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Take my words with a grain of salt. I have some experience with both, but I know GA8 far better.I like both a lot and can play just fine with either. Producing spin, for me, felt a bit easier with GA8 than with Mantra M in serving and in pushes. When looping and counterlooping both produce good quality shots, close to each other. Both are very fast, but (again, to me) feel very controllable. As far as linearity goes, I couldn't really say. Both are modern tensor-type rubbers, of course, but both are not extremely bouncy. I could cope with either of them in the touch game, but I think that's very level-relative."
149,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I use Mantra M red in max on forhand on a Sanwei Fextra blade. And im really impressed about it. I tried ALOT of rubbers maybe about 10 rubbers like Tenergy 05, Razka 7, Andro Rasanter R 47 and so on.But with Mantra M i really enjoying playing. I can hit all over the table with it, theres no limit with it. The spin is amacing in opening loops with a lower speed but ALOT of spin when i brushes the rubber. In serving its Fantastic.For my style of playing its the BEST fh rubber ever. Im hoping it will never go out of production"
150,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Can you say more about the difference between rakza 7 and Mantra M ? I hesitate between both
151,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,GoldArc should be somewhat spinnier but i like the Mantra M as a bh rubber better because it is not spin sensitive abd it is more bouncy.
152,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I really fell every Ball on the racket crisp and controlling both active and passive shots with Manta M.The rubber doesnt surprice you wtih catapult effect. You get power in your shots if you want to attact no tensor in it, whitch i really like.Razka 7 is also a okay rubber. Much more spin sensitive than Mantra M. Thinking Razka 7 is a older type of modern rubber."
153,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Mantra M is japanese made, GA8 is german made.Just by that it is easy to say Mantra is more linear, has better topsheet and lasts longer."
154,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I somewhat like this reasoning from principles, but still don't subscribe to its conclusion."
155,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Not sure about that. Played with the 47,5 degree version a while ago and thought it was really good, comparable to bluefire/Evolution and co. But I thought the Mantra M was a different beast altogether, up there with tenergy05 (and quite similar in the Made-in-Japan style playing characteristics)."
156,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Mantra like other Daiki made rubbers still has lesser spin compared to ESN rubbers though if you ask me which i prefer overall, i would go with the Mantra."
157,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"that's ok. From my experience, it is mostly true though. ESN rubbers have more factory tuning and perform significantly worse after 2-3 months."
158,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I think I glued on my GA8/50 early july, and am nearing that mark (with about 10-12 hours of play in a good week). You did rouse my interest in Mantra, but I'm not done with my little infatuation with a hardish FH rubber just yet so might give Mantra H a thought or two. Hopefully I'll come across somebody playing it."
159,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Mantra H is actually a pretty decent rubber for fh. It is faster than a lot of esn rubbers. I like it as a bh rubber. It packs a punch.
160,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Even more of a punch than GA8 at 50º does? That's already quite punchful to me.But that's not what I like most about it. The best part (to me) is not the availability of the high gears, but the lack of bounciness in the lower gears. I do get to blast past my opponents with quality shots, true, but it's the reliability I get in the short game that seals it for me. Tight and spinny short pushes if I want them to be. This helps a lot. Is Mantra (esp. H) like that also?"
161,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"I think mantra h is really fast but as expected from a fast rubber, the gears are less compared to a 50 degree rubber."
162,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"Without having as much xp as you folks, I would say short game is where I find the mantra (M in my case) a bit lacking. It is a fast rubber and as long as you have confidence in your strokes you can definitely go quite far with it (especially on flat hits when you manage to get a bit of high ball back), but the short game requires a very good touch to be efficient (especially in 2.1mm). I personally use it as a fh rubber, paired wit a 2.2mm genesis 2 M in the backhand, which I particularly like."
163,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,I know quite a lot of players that has replaced T05 with Mantra M and are super happy with it. Mantra H on the other hand quite a few people (former T05 players) are unhappy with as it's extremely fast.
164,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,"To be honest, Mantra H's speed is more on the Bryce Speed range so it is not surprising that people find it too fast."
165,5f68739df57afe037caed073,DHS Goldarc 8 vs Stiga Mantra M,Mantra is not made by chinese DHS ?

167,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings,Take revspin ratings with a massive grain of salt. That's all I can say. They are purely based on user ratings and you could see how this can already be a disaster because the majority of the users don't have adequate trainings and thus aren't equipped to rate anything properly.
168,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings,"Anyone can add reviews and change the ratings that way. That's nothing official or scientific there, always take these infos with a grain of salt."
169,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings,A manufacturer could send someone their to rate to inspire their sales.
170,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings,"Revspin is completely subjective. Good gauge of opinions, especially with the rubbers that have 100+ reviews, but not comparable at all.For some objective ratings using controlled parameters, search for ""Contra.de"" rubber table or something like that. Sorry, I don't speak German."
171,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings,"Better to put a rubber and blade through a dynamic test. Often, this is the way TTD does reviews... it produces more usable information."
172,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings,"Relatable, yes. Entertaining, yes. Informative, yes, certainly when Dan's doing them with a pro showing off extreme skills to highlight some or other rubber feat (Can Accuzu doing the short off-the-bounce chop/push, Timo Boll showing topspin variation and power).Comparable, less so. The dynamic tests Dan did (mostly with Tom), have a core repertoire of flicks, counters, openups, counterspins at the table, in mid-position and away from the table. But they also visit interesting areas now and then, but not always, that I found very insightful. An example would be the focus on the short game in (I believe) the T80 review.And while these reviews are geared towards the hyperbole, I think observing them while ignoring the commentation somewhat is insightful. In the Rasanter review both Dan and Tom had very positive words, even though they were visibly having a hard time to adapt and the unforced error rate (in the edited footage!) to me seemed rather high, well above their usual standard.I take away many things from these reviews, but one thing I cannot get from them is to get a view of different rubbers in comparison."
173,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings,I think you should forget looking at the ratings of the rubbers. Better if you just try it and you will feel the difference after some time. And you will be able to compare the rubbers yourself. Without any rating.
174,5f6873cff57afe037caed086,Revspin Rubber Ratings,The only way to do a good review is the way Pathfinderpro did his reviews. Pathfinderpro did his best to remove the subjective opinion part of a review.

176,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,Thanks @RidTheKidI have tried Vega China. It's a great half tacky rubber Xiom produced. Nice control and good spin. I just feel it lacks the powerful kick H3 has when you do power loop. So I thought the high end Omega VII might offer a better sponge.

178,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,"Actually, vega china is faster than h3 and needs lesser effort. With O7A, you will have a fster rubber but somewhat lesser spin on pure loops. With powershots away from the table, it outclasses H3."
179,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,A boosted battle 2 39-40 hardness and boosted 2 layers would do the trick. Alot more gears and more spin than H3.
180,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,Interesting. I have played Battle 2 before without boosting. The spin is mediocre compared to H3. Control is ok and power is good. I dumped my Battle 2 after two sessions.Sent from my PAR-LX9 using Tapatalk

182,5f6873d2f57afe037caed087,Omega VII Asia vs Hurricane 3,"I've used Battle II provincial. I think Battle II is a bit overrated and I would stick with H3 which has a solid track record after many years in the market. If a person's style suits Chinese tacky rubber, I'd say look no further than H3/H3N provincial. Forget any other tacky rubbers or hybrid euro/Chinese rubbers out there because they really just don't live up to H3 at the end of the day.Get the 39 (40 if you are very well advanced, 41 if you are insane) degree in hardness and boost it a couple of layers and you are set. Omega VII Asia would be a modern tensor rubber that plays completely differently from H3. It may be slightly less bouncier and offers somewhat more control than other tensor rubbers, but it would never replace H3."

However when boosted/speed glued properly, B2 Provincial is still playable and is a cheaper alternative than H3P. I am currently using B2P right now, the other thing that I like from B2P is the strong glue between topsheet and sponge. I use speed glue and reglue every time before I play. There's no bubble or topsheet peeled off from the sponge which I had several times with H3p."

The AK47 has more bounce and speed. If you have ever used the Stiga Genesis M rubber, the AK47 Yellow is a slightly harder and faster version. Though, the Genesis M has better grip. Actually, the Genesis M feels closer to the AK47 Blue. I often find the AK47 rubbers allow the ball to slip and lose grip (this may be blade dependent). If you need a light rubber to balance out a setup it is worth a try.The Hadou 40+ is a nice rubber. It is a tacky rubber, but the tackiness is not in the same league as Battle II. The response and feeling is otherwise similar to Battle 2. It is a good middle ground rubber, a do everything rubber. It is not a fast rubber, more of a high control rubber. I found that the Hadou 40+ rubber is a good rubber to put on blades that have too much bounce / catapult for your game. I found the Hadou 40+ to be one of the best rubbers to put on the Sanwei F3 Pro (innerforce alc version). This was a very bouncy blade for me and the Hadou 40+ tamed it very nicely. The last time I tried that blade I ran Battle 2 on the FH and Hadou 40+ on the BH. My only issue with that setup is there was no feeling at all. Otherwise, it offered good control and was still very fast. Keep in mind, I am more of a beginner to the game, and I play closer to the table due to limited space in my playing locations.Hope this helps..."
216,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"Thank you for explaining, it does help. I am currently using Stiga Mantra M and H which AFAIK are the descendants of Genesis so then the AK47 line would be comparable with these? With the the Hadou being slower although supposedly designed for the heavier balls if I understand correctly."
217,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"AK-47 is totally non-tacky. It's basically an attempt at a euro style rubber. Hadou is a typical tacky rubber. Yinhe Jupiter II (38 degree) is my favorite tacky rubber. Way easier to use (and better non boosted performance) than Hadou, Hurricane 3 Neo, and the rest. (Haven't tried Battle II yet, but it's not as easy to use as Jupiter II from what I have heard.). I'm not sure how I feel about AK-47. I have the blue version on backhand and I don't get that much spin with it. I like CJ8000 Biotech better. (It's semi-tacky). Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
218,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"I have never tried Mantra, so cannot compare. I don't think the Genesis and Mantra are that close in playing characteristics. The AK47 might be more comparable to the Genesis II, since it was so close to the original Genesis. AK47 is faster then original Genesis just like the Genesis II is. The AK47 has less overall grip for sure. One thing, for what ever reason I found the AK47 to work very well for opening up on backspin balls. Better than the Genesis in this regard. Genesis was better for topspins though.Yeah, the Hadou 40+ is a slower rubber with a medium to medium-low throw. Offers good grip and good spin. Works well on some blades, and is too slow on others. I have used Rakza 7 on most of my setups. It is just the first decent rubber that I chose. I am comfortable with it, so it is my go to (the 4-3 price on TT11 helps). In the past, if I ever put Rakza 7 on a blade and it was too fast, too lively. I could fix that by putting on a sheet of Hadou 40+."
219,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"I can agree that the Hadou 40+ is easier to use than the Battle 2. If I was to keep using that Sanwei F3 Pro, I would have put Hadou 40+ on both sides and removed the Battle 2.I also agree that the AK47 rubbers lack spin. For example, I have used the AK47 Blue and Genesis M on a DHS H301 blade. The AK47 Blue was a little bit faster than the Geneis M. The sponge softness felt very similar, it just had a little more speed. The AK47 Blue was better at lifting backspin balls on both the FH and BH side. However, I can consistently generate more topspin with the Genesis M. This is for both FH and BH topspins. The AK47's just do not feel stable to me on topspins."
220,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"Mantra and Genesis are completely different rubbers. Mantra is ""made in Japan"" and Genesis is OEM manufactured by DHS.Mantra is a tensor type rubber.Genesis (and Genesis II) is a hybrid rubber (chinese top sheet with European like high tension sponge).Both are extremely different to any version of AK47."
221,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"The construction may be different, but IMO, the overall play of Genesis M and AK47 Blue is similar. On my H-301 blade anyway.Sent from my SM-N960U using Tapatalk"
222,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,"They are very different rubbers. For me, the AK47 series are speed oriented rubbers while the Hadou40+ is spin oriented. It doesn't feel like a typical chinese tacky rubber. Overall it's a little softer, the topsheet is very different and the sponge has a different texture than B2 or H3. Out of the package is not very fast, however it has a very strong reaction to booster and becomes a totally different rubber. It's more forgiving than B2 or H3 and you can even get that clicking sound typical of tensors."
223,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,Interesting stuff. I ended up ordering the Jupiter II and AK47 Yellow to try out. Julian
224,5f687402f57afe037caed09b,Palio Hadou 40+ vs Ak47 Yellow,ak47 lacks the punching power that battle 2 has got.ak 47 red and blue sponge kinda sucks imo lacks something that the yellow has . also big dipper is a option
225,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Yeah, this sums G1 v Baracuda up very well. G1 is pretty close to the ever-popular, dearly-departed Adidas P7. G1 is definitely faster than Baracuda, pretty much equal in spin on stronger strokes. Baracuda gives more spin on lower-effort shots though, which makes it more spin sensitive as well, as you've mentioned."
226,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),baracuda is less durable. It easily chips at the side of the topsheet.
227,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),so what does this mean for opening up backspin balls with an attack.is it easier with the baracuda due to its higher spin on low attack balls oris it easier with the fastarc due to the amount of spin which is to override
228,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"This depends on your technique and habits IMO. I tend to be aggressive when opening up off backspin so they're pretty much as easy as each other, but I got a faster ball with G1. On ""softer"" openers, Baracuda seemed to generate a higher arc so it was easier in that sense.Don't overthink it too much. The main difference is that G1 is a bit faster. Quite similar overall, both good rubbers. Yogi's point about durability is a good one too."
229,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),for me as a beginner the spin-sensivity is a big factor. recieves are a big winning condition.if i could have quite a similar rubber like Baracuda but with an improved chance of avoiding recieve errors then i would do the change. i choosed the Barauda as my daily rubber because i can do lazy backspin into topspin attack as well as hard shots. with H3 and other hard°rubbers i only could do hard shots.thus this aspect is also important.btw Andy: u choosed R47 as ur primary rubber. may u give me a short comparison between it and g1/bara please.
230,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I have a Kid that plays with Baracuda, as he is a chopper, I chose that rubber for him, he can attack very agressively with more spin than the older better players that use M1, or even tenergy, the ball comes really heavy.He can still chop with the FH and is a very difficult shot to top spin.I love that rubber, and with a little bit of booster, is the best.stay with baracuda, it's great."
231,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"R47 is really different. G1 and Baracuda are from a similar ESN release cycle, have a lot of similar properties. Rasanter is more recent - you get a matte topsheet, less catapult, more linearity (and for me, a better feeling of ""grab"" on the plastic ball, but not everyone agrees with that). Add to that a lower arc and it's a different proposition. It needs more effort to list backspin for sure. But I don't like the older ESN rubbers with the plastic ball - otherwise I'd probably be using G1 (in the absence of Adidas P7).That said, I'm not the best person to ask about why I'm using my current setup. I change my rubber too often, so I'm not totally committed to anything you see in my signature. I'm looking very closely at a few new semi-tacky hybrid rubbers at the moment so it could all change in a flash."
232,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If you're prepared to use booster and don't mind the faff, this is a good shout too. Baracuda is cheap(ish) too!"
233,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I have club members playing with years-old Baracuda. They don't look fresh, somewhat stained, but still generate tons of spin, and are not crumbling away at the edges. Well, aside from the expected damage to rubber as well as blade after clipping the table."
234,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Indeed. Which is why I think it´s quite funny that over on German TT News some people now treat G1 as the answer to all questions and a serious alternative to tenergy. If that generation (or any ...) had been, the news would´ve spread earlier "
235,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"I think it is because some JNT members use it. Also, the new ball has made that generation more playable across the board even Hexer and Genius."
236,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"The Fastarc G-1 is an absolute oddity.It was released in July 2010, so over 2 years after Tenergy and close to 1 year after Baracuda/Hexer/Genius/X-plode. Unlike the others that started with a bang and then sank into oblivion, Fastarc G-1 has been in and out the top 10 of Table Tennis Kingdom sales ranking during the last years of 40mm, and only really became a best-seller well after the switch to the 40+(July, 2014). It's going strong in the ABS era(April, 2017) and has been at the top for the past 2 years except for 2 months, when Rozena temporarily dethroned it in Aug and Sep 2017."
237,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),May I throw in Vega Pro.I had both VP and Baracuda on same blade. Baracuda was miles ahead for me. Don't get the hype of it as a Tenergy clone.
238,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),Vega pro is not comparable to baracuda but rather Acuda S2. I think Sigma 2 pro is closer to baracuda
239,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"In terms of sponge hardness, would the Rasanter R42 be closest to the Baracuda/G1?"
240,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"As the name suggests, the R42 has a sponge hardness of 42° on the ESN-scale (I think they use Shore A), whereas the G-1 has a sponge hardness of 47.5°, so that's a rather significant difference. The R47 would be closer (if we're only talking about sponge hardness)."
241,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Yes, absolutely.There will never be a good direct comparison between Baracuda and the Rasanter series - the whole rubber composition is just too different. The new Hexers might be a closer match, if you want something new."
242,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If someone is used to using Tenergy 05, should they try the R47 out of the Rasanter series? How does the R47 and Tenergy 05 compare?"
243,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"If you absolutely had to pick a Rasanter to replace T05, it would be R47 yes. But they aren't that close. IMO R47 is more linear, easier to use, much better blocking and flat hitting, less sensitive to spin. But it's also lower arc and you have to put your own muscle into the stroke to get good spin out. It rewards committed strokes with good performance. T05 is generally more spinny across a whole range of gears but has all the usual T05 demands - spin sensitivity, catapult, price. R47 is the better rubber for my needs, but it's a personal decision rather than R47 being a T05 clone or something like that."
244,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Fantastic thanks Andy I needed that sort of review/comparison. How does R47 play away from the table in looping, counter looping and fishing? Also how is it for close to the table attacking and serving? I presume it's quite good in the short game compared to Tenergy 05?How would the R47 play on a Joo Se Hyuk blade would it suit?Lastly, what differences do I get from different sponge thicknesses with the R47?"
245,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"It's very likely ESN use Asker C, which has a spherical indenter. DHS use Shore A, which has a truncated cone indenter. Because of that, simple translation and direct comparison between the 2 scales are prone to error and not recommended."
246,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Away from the table looping - it's OK. Spin is good but from distance you have to pay attention to the arc because it stays lower than some of its peers.Counterlooping - excellent. It's very stable and forgiving of timing/power errors. Counter tends to stay low and nasty.Fishing - not really my bag, hard to comment.Close-in - it's solid. Great for flicks, close counters, basic drives. Because it's a bit inert compared to, say, MX-P, you have to muscle backspin openers a bit more than livelier rubbers. Serving is OK but I needed to make some adjustments to get good spin on short serves - needs care to avoid sending the serve into the middle zone.Much easier in the short game, blocking, than T05 for me. It's easier and more predictable in general. But if you're used to T05 and happy with the way it plays, you'd probably find R47 a bit dead and lifeless. It's all a very personal experience.I haven't used a Joo so can't say for sure. If you send me a PM I can send you a gently-used sheet of R47 in black ultramax to try out if you want. Might be a bit small for the Joo headsize though.Thickness - R47 has the new-ish thin topsheet/thicker sponge concept so plays a bit softer than you might expect with 47.5 hardness. I use Ultramax on the FH at the mo and it gives a little more catapult and more headroom when playing harder shots to get spin out of it. Thinner sponges (in general, IMO) tend to play a touch harder, less catapulty, more direct, and you sacrifice top-end spin for a little more straight-line speed. So Max to support looping, thinner for driving/hitting I would say.These things tend to be very personal impressions and YMMV. Best to try it out if you can. Only way to be sure!"
247,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"You are correct, zeio. ESN uses C; I mixed it up."
248,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"so guys i need to replace my rubber due to deterioration.is it worth to try out the g1 as baracuda fan?i am afraid that with harder sponge it will be much less comfort in doing all kind of shots well, esp opening up backspin."
249,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Andy, I don't suppose you still have the R47 do you? PM me!"
250,5f687453f57afe037caed0c6,Fastarc G-1 (vs. Baracuda),"Moving between rubber hardness levels is more difficult than moving between rubber brands/types. It's a huge difference.But you won't know till you try. Yes, it will be harder to perform shots you rely on, lifting backspin especially will be harder, but on the other hand, if you have the physical power for it, the harder rubbers will perform better and pressure opponents more with more speed and spin.That said, just replacing rubbers isn't a magic spell, you won't get any of that extra speed and spin unless you're fit and have great technique. Without all that you'll just have a lot less speed and spin."
251,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"When I wanted to choose rubbers, I tried them both from teammates. I'm intermediate and haven't tried many rubbers at all.Both where tested on an innerforce alc blade for one session of 2 hours each. For me and my skills, mxs was rock hard and quite uncontrollable, but very fast and very spinny I'd say.Rakza was fast too, but not so fast, it was quite spinny too, maybe a little less than mxs but can't be sure about that, and I could control it quite easily.I would like to state again that my level is much lower than most players here and probably I can't review the whole potential of the rubbers, I'm just saying my experience."
252,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"Mxs is spinnier but feels harder. Also, mxs is much more durable."
253,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Try rakza 7 soft
254,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"I'm not sure why Yogi says mxp is more durable. Rakza7 is about 4 times as durable than anything in the Evolution series.Anyway, MX-P is faster and better for direct play. Rakza7 is spinnier.But a lot of it depends on synergy with the blade.Both are difficult rubbers. Try something else.Rakza7 soft is an awesome suggestion."
255,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,MX-S not MX-P...MX-S is known to be a very durable rubber. Rakza 7 just an average ESN rubber on that regard.
256,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"You're right, MX-S is better than MX-P, where the booster effect wears off pretty fast and it becomes eh...But MX-S is less durable than rakza7 also. I used MX-S for 2 sheets. It kept fraying around the edges and sort of crumbling. Granted this is my experience but I've read from quite a few others that this is indeed a tendency of the evolution series.It may be considered durable because the sponge is hard, but Rakza7 has a sponge about as hard only with a lasting topsheet. Rakza is much better than those newer synthetic rubbers."
257,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"If you are choosing between Rakza 7 and MX-S, compromise with Fastarc G1. I think it has good things from both rubbers."
258,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"I have a TB-ALC. I have had S2, MX-S and Rakza 7 2mm on both sides. The S2 played well but I felt it was too soft for the FH. I tried MX-S because it was harder. It wasn't bad but it just didn't feel right. The rubber shrank on the blade. I was not happy about that.I like Rakza 7. It seems to be between S2 and MX-S.BTW, I have a c-pen YEO with Rakza 7 soft max on it. I have posted video me playing c-pen with it on the ""how many c-pen players are there"" thread. Rakza 7 soft max is very spinny as demonstrated in the video.i don't see a need for Rakza 7 max unless you play far from the table and really need to hit hard often without worrying about bottoming out the sponge."
259,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,These two rubbers don't work well on the new ABS ball. Go for MXP instead. Spinnier and faster.Go for Gewo Nexxus EL pro 48 which gives really good feel with crazy speed and spin.
260,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Actually mxs was designed for the polyball and is newer than mxp.

266,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,Is G1 faster than rakza?
267,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I’ve heard it’s slightly slower but harder and spinnier. But I don’t know how much weight I can hold to one persons opinion. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
268,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I agree. Slower really means more linear with less catapult. I really don't like the catapult of Vega Pro either so I prefer G1 to it as well.
269,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,I thought u used to play with MX-S?
270,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"I did. I also used to play with Karis M and Tenergy 05 too, remember? Even did a brief stint with Genius.But I wanted something that suited my current game after taking a 9 month hiatus. To cut a long story short, Fastarc G1 is now being sold at reasonable prices in Europe and I gave it a shot and loved it."
271,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,What about it do you like so much?In comparison to MX-S for example? To who would you recommend it?
272,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"Hey NextLevel,Since G1 is harder than R7, do you have to actually hit harder to engage a bit more sponge to create a safer attack with an arching topspin?Did you have to adjust your stroke at all from R7 to G1?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
273,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"I wrote a review but I would say that G1 is the best rubber of the ESN generation that includes Baracuda, Hexer, Genius, Xplode, Vega Pro etc.It is for people who want durable spinny rubbers and aren't necessarily looking for the fastest stuff. It has Tenergy like throw angles but with less speed and better blocking characteristics as it is less spin sensitive from the sponge catapult. But the price for value is where it really shines as you can get 4 sheets for roughly $120, making it a bargain in this era of overpriced rubbers which may suit pros but does nothing for amateurs. I think it can suit a wide variety of players - it definitely isn't as much work as MX-S to use. I know a guy who couldn't use anything but Tenergy until he used G1. It feels hard when it starts but it gets softer and the topsheet is very very grippy. It takes much less effort to get heavy spin."
274,5f687466f57afe037caed0ce,Rakza 7 vs Evolution MX-S?,"G1 is very easy to brush with. The topsheet is very grippy, almost like Chinese rubber. It is slower than Tenergy and only a little slower than Rakza 7 but I never played Rakza 7 for extended period. My club mate who did said he preferred G1 and thought it was an improved Razka 7 when he tested it ( and this was without my asking for that comparison). He uses a Tenergy right now but just liked G1 for the control. I can play very slow spinny loops during warmup without much effort - that is how grippy G1 topsheet is and how easy it is to spin with it. Again it may not be for everyone but lots of people will like it if they try it. It is the most popular rubber in Japan for good reason.A lot of these rubbers while old play better with plastic than with celluloid. G1 is one of them."

I’m excited to try it once my sheet of R7 on the Bh is done!I’ve been praising R7 for the BH since I’ve started to use it but I found a great deal on G1 that I couldn’t pass up to try it. Here we go!

276,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"I would say to stick to Baracuda, is a great rubber, and if needed just add some booster."
277,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),Genius is an absolutely excellent rubber. It's the most used rubber in my club.I'm not a fan of the lifespan of these rubbers though.
278,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),Can you compare how this rubber to a Tenergy? I've always used Tenergies and every time I try to switch to a tensor I don't have a good experience. The nearest I've tried to the Barracuda was the Genius Sound and didn't like it.
279,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"The underlying philosophies are still too different.Of course, you may achieve a similar performance, or in other words play just as well with a Tensor rubber. The feeling on ball contact will never be the same, though.If you want the closest feeling to tenergy05, you might want to try Stiga Mantra M - made in Japan, not a Tensor (German) by definition, but a great rubber.If you want to try a Tensor rubber again, you might want to opt for a newer generation. Many people have switched to Tibhar Evolution MX-P (due to clever marketing thinking it was Japanese, which at that time was still all the rage), with bluefire M1 and Rasant (turbo/PowerGrip) being quite similar. There are quite a few more rubbers that have served people well, such as XIOM Vega pro, a currently (due to recommendation from a pro) discovered GEWO Hype EL and of course all the new stuff like Rasanter, Aurus Prime (probably the closest in feeling to tenergy05) or GEWO Nexxus. As for the comparison of Baracuda to Genius, they are pretty close siblings from the same generation, but I found the Baracuda a bit easier to play (softer topsheet/sponge). I would not spend money on Genius (otherwise on itself an excellent rubber, make no mistake) just to find that they are quite similar."

281,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),I've played with Genius for a while. I would suggest sticking with Baraxuda because the durability really isn't that great and the rubber changes its playing characteristics over time
282,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"This is very difficult to say. About a year ago, one of my friends (third league Germany) in good supply of ""select pro"" Tensor rubbers (in other words almost the best that most companies can supply ...) said that t05 ""speaks a whole different language"". I know this doesn´t translate into speed, spin or even throw angle comparisons ... Depending on how you play you might not even find a benefit, but you´d sure feel a difference.In technical terms, tenergy is obviously still able to produce more spin than European rubbers - in the right hands. On amateur level I think it´s a matter of preference and money. I love the way t05 feels, but it costs 60 Euro (no discount). The closest I know (Mantra M) I can get for 35, the closest Tensor I know (Aurus Prime) for even less. And the ones I play, I mostly get for free, and they´re easily good enough for higher skills than mine, so that´s money saved and no considerable disadvantage for me. But I have friends from third league and beyond who get to try every new Tensor generation and don´t ever think about switching."
283,5f687487f57afe037caed0e4,Tibhar Genius (vs Donic Baracuda),"The bad thing is none of my friends play with it either, so I can't even try it out. Not even the pro players I know use them. For me, trying Tenergy is just out of pure curiosity, since there's absolutely nothing wrong with Rhyzers I have. They're almost perfect."

286,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"The thing with tacky Chinese rubbers in the backhand is that when it comes to a bh to bh rally or punchblocking, the ball has a tendency to hit the net. This can be resolved by slightly brushing the ball but it is easier to just use a german or jap rubber. If you like hurricane 3 then get an alternative hard rubber in the backhand that is spinny but also gives you bounce. Mantra h 2.0mm, joola maxxx 500 2.0mm, xiom vega tour and many other rubbers."
287,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"What blade are you using?Tensor rubber is not ""more risk more reward"". It is not faster either, it is less linear. You get decent speed without putting in the effort, so that at first glance you can get away with mistiming or approximate technique. Non-boosted Chinese tacky rubber is almost as fast once you're aiming for power, and in my experience the shots are often perceived as spinnier and equally powerful. Basically with H3N and similar rubber, what you get is what you put in (I'm talking in terms of stroke quality rather than physicality).You can't really go wrong playing with either tacky or tensor rubbers. Both types are good with their own qualities. The only bad choice for a relative beginner is to go with an unforgiving tensor rubber, like tenergy 05 > 2mm, or most tensor rubbers in max thickness.The way I read your post is that you're facing some obstacles towards progressing and your instinct is to turn to your equipment (like all of us). Instead, you'll want to improve your technique and your tactics even more. Identify what's having the biggest negative impact on your game and fix it.On the topic of power: http://www.tabletenniscoaching.com/node/1927"

Also, if a rubber forces body rotation on your FH, that is good. You need to develop that as a habit. Power will come in time.Find something reasonable and stick with it. There is no equipment that will speed up your improvement. But constantly changing will slow you down."
289,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"First off thanks for the replication!yogi_bearI already tried a 50° Tensor on my backhand. While the passive play was smooth, i had hesitation to play active in order to avoid the ball go out of the table. My main question was about getting used to it and go for a little softer Tensor Version or stick with the comfortable/safety option H3. I haven't issue with BH rallies nor blocking but the amout of speed (low-moderate) and spin (nearly no at all) while playing. I guess adding spin just require to work von it (like i said i was too hesitant for looping and always took the safety shot with my BH, thats why looping technique isnt good tho).The main question in this regard is: can i develop a BH weapon with sticky hard (H3) or mid-hart (H3-50) chinese rubber or do i have to switch to a tensor.talbonthank you for the link. I agree with the linearity, thats why i love the chinese rubber, but i feel there's a power lose due to the stickiness. I get the feeling that i wont ever get the physical effort needed to play the H3 at it's optimum, i think even the chinese pro's boost it just to match it with the hardness of the other's pro's equipment. i cant believe them playing the hard version like i do. tbh i dont see that much of physical power improvement, thats why i consider a more softer chinese or european version (like H3-50, maybe H8?)Baalu'r right, equipment wont increase my development speed, but on the other hand i do have a imagination of my playstyle and if this doesnt match with the equipment, i will lose time to develop in the right direction.right now i did find my basic on forehand with H3 and wants to convert into smth which is a bit easier to execut with an increase of the output given the current input. on the backhand side i did try both philosophies and kinda need smth inbetween, already mentioned it at my replay to yogi_bear.thanks for the inputiamsan"
290,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"Well I find it very hard to understand what it is you're saying or asking and I'd suggest being more concise.Regarding backhand tacky rubbers, not a good idea generally unless you know you can ALWAYS commit to an active attacking stroke with the backhand and being able to precisely judge the spin on the ball at all times.Tacky of course isn't the problem, but rather that these tacky rubbers are almost always hard and very linear rubbers so without effort you get no speed. Hence, net balls."
291,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,I think you need a layer of seamoon in your h3 to be perfect for you. In the backhand maybe something like skyline 3-60 will suit better.Sent from my Redmi Note 4 using Tapatalk

Tacky rubber demander better technnique to execute a good shot (you CAN hit shots that you wont be able to with a tensor but for me not worth it)"
293,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"You are using an all+ blade, so you shouldn't have a hard time controlling a more active rubber. Try a tenergy on your bh (2.1 sponge). I like t05, but maybe t80 is for you. Then sometimes in a practice flip it over and try it on your fh. You might like it. Most forum geniuses hate it, but it sure sounds to me like the answer to your question is tenergy. Unless you want to boost the hurricane. That's an option too, but it's more work. Tenergy will make you give up on passive receives, but you won't need a professional athlete's physique to play. No free lunches, everything adds somewhere, takes away somewhere else."
294,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"I have used tacky rubbers on backhand (In fact I broke USATT 2000 with a tacky rubber on my backhand) and the main thing is your stroke size and the limitations that come with it. If you are like Ma Long able to get into position and play fuller strokes, tacky rubber is great because you can be positive all the time. If sometimes you want to make that shot while out of position, well that is where tacky rubber leaves you a little dissatisfied. Tacky rubber work best if you want to reloop every ball close to the table. Tenergy 05 has a dimension that is similar to this which is why some players use it for this style as well.There is ultimately no single way. You just know your style and adapt. If I was healthy, I suspect I would use tacky rubbers on both sides of I played close to the table and something like Tenergy if I backed up a little."

297,5f6876d864fe8d59b1ff547e,DHS vs. Tensor - long term investment,"hi guys, i wanted to give un update about my decision.since last training session i switched to the tensor (R50) on both sides. I must say my play feels alot smoother and i really enjoy the less demanding play, in fact i got alot safer with the beginning stroke TS on US... while this was kind of random with the H3 without the feel why it was going wrong, now it's way more safer. i did even some loopkills in a row on underspin for fun, this was impossible with the chinese's ones. my backhand is going to improve aswell. its less forgiving if ur stroke isnt properly or false unlike the H3, where u got real big control due to the sticky sheet... but if u hit right the quality of the balls are satisfying.the biggest reason for the switch was the dust which overrides the stickyness real quick... i cant even do a full match with atleast 3 sets.so what's my future goals... i dont think i can get to the full potential of the R50 right now.... with a lot of preperation i could loopkill balls with my fh, the occasion's in a match game will be rare for this... so on fh side i wanna improve the consistency of the opening and following loop... on backhand side i do have some good approaches, i need to get good stroke movements there first...just a mention on the s&r side: i did some test games. my serves weren't that good as before. while i'd get ALOT of direct points just by my serves in league games with the H3, now they are just undangerous. on the recieve side i kinda feel more comfortable now... while the tackyness helped me to get the recieve real short, more often the ball was too short. my short game isnt dangerous anymore, but i kinda got some more control feeling back.so far. thanks for all the input. really appreciate that.iamsan"

302,5f6876df64fe8d59b1ff5482,Which one do you prefer on BH between EL-P vs EL-S,EL-S is mu choice since the el-p easily loses its bounciness and the el-s is spinnier with a lil bit more bounce. The el-p feels dead sometimes.

320,5f68772064fe8d59b1ff54a5,Tensor vs chinese,"Try both.But try the best of each.And don't try a hard chinese tacky rubber on your backhand. That's unhelpfulCorrect me if I'm wrong, anyone:Hard tacky rubber are better at very specific aspects:1) Generating a ton of spin on low energy balls (like serves and serve returns)2) Accuracy in low power shots (tackiness+hard sponge)3) More powerful than anything if you topspin with a lot of power (hard sponge=speed, tack=able to grab the ball in angles that would be difficult for non-tacky rubbers)4) Easy to alter the pace of the game (hard sponge, tack, no tensor, meaning that you can return a ball very fast or surprisingly slow if you want)While tensors are better at being consistently fast, which is great with:1) Low power reaction shots, but only against medium speed balls (IE the late-reaction-block, cuz it'll be returned with speed)2) Medium power shots (which are the great majority of shots for beginner/club level players)3) Require less effort to play quality shotsSecondary differences are that:1) Chinese rubbers are much, much cheaper generally2) Chinese hard/tacky rubbers are, in my experience, longer lived. The hard rubber 'breaks in' and remains good forever basically, and the tackiness takes a loooooong time to go away completely (actually never happened to me yet), and the thing about tackiness is that even a little bit of tackiness is enough to grip the ball at the same level as a brand new non tacky rubber. Granted, I always keep my chinese rubbers under a plastic sheet, while I don't do that with my tensors.3) Chinese hard/tacky rubbers are extremely vulnerable to moisture and dirt. If you play in a badly air-conditioned, dirty place, you can kiss the rubber goodbye after like 15 minutes of play, until you clean it well and let it dry well. If the air where you play is very humid, there is no hope for you.My suggestion:Try the 729 Battle II as a tacky rubber. Ask for hardness 45. It's a ""modern"" chinese rubber."

328,5f68774964fe8d59b1ff54bf,Rakza 7 soft MAX VS Tibhar Evo EL-S 1.9 on BH ?,"concerning El-s it depends what you expect from the rubber. personally it has a great ""feeling"" on composite blades. I can feel the ball sinking into the rubber quite well while not getting mushy. however el-s is a matter of taste.Compared to the Mantra M id say the catapult isnt as prominent and the rubber is not as fast. i cant tell if there are differences in dwell because i only hit a few times with the mantra M.I personally think that El-s is a great backhand rubber but it has its flaws. active blocking is great. you can punch the balls with a lower arc and if pressured you dont have to close your bat angle as much. that effect is very obvious when switching from el-s to vega pro and the other way around. passive blocking however is delicate. i think when the sponge isnt engaged the ball flys into the net (which is a key difference when playing with tenergy05 to which this rubber was compared alot). Thats why id recommend to spinblock most balls for more safety. short game pushing needs a little attention.So all in all you need a solid technique to get the El-s going but then it is a powerful backhand rubber. I would suggest this rubber to players who like to have a harder rubber on backhand (around 47.5 degree) while retaining good control.So in your case Id say either test the el-s first or go with the rakza soft which ive never played. Also you couldgo for fx-s instead of el-s for more control and less power. But thats only what ive read without having played that rubber.My impressions are are about a 2.1mm El-S"

330,5f68776a64fe8d59b1ff54d1,MX-S vs. Genesis M,I havent played MX-S. The Genesis is probably lighter. 2.0: around 42g-47g cut (157x150)2.2: around 45g-50gIm pretty sure that MX-S on average is heavier.Topsheet: really grippy which doesnt wear off for a long timedurability: the rubber has a longer lifespan than an average rubber so probably more than MX-S.You easily get more than 100 hours out of it. With that being said topsheet and rubber are delicate. Edges get messed up easily.Arc is medium-medium high and a long trajectory. I find the 2.2 plays more euro style and u dont have to apply as much force as 2.0.But those are just my observations.

I had it on Innerforce Layer Al and it was really mushy (like pillow soft) If you like the safety of soft sponge it is good but I thought it lacked power personally compared to Elp or els with not as much spin. Xiom rubber good if you fancy a change try the Vega Pro, quite similar to elp, little harder but still good control and more spin, speed. Or even try els because that it a nice rubber I had on fh and bh and was quite surprised at how nice it was. Hope this help, is my view only though"
339,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"that is quite different opinion of what tibhar says: 45 degrees is quite hard, it shoult be harder then EL-P. On polish website I have found that quantum is very spinny, while you say it is more fast the spinny.i think I better stay with EL-P, which is good variation for FH rubber enough spin, enough fast and enough hard."
340,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"I would deffo try els, just a spinnier verion but though it had enough speed and control but with an extra bit of grip on topsheet. Quantum was deffo softer though if I remember right."
341,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"Just to make one thing clear, although the Quantums were released after the first Evolution rubbers they are by no means an update.There is the Evolution line with new additions EL-S and FX-S and there is among others a Quantum line developed in parallel. A Quantum rubber compared to an Evolution rubber will most probably feel like a step back as the Quantums are meant to be more safe and easy to play."
342,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"thanks this is what I wanted to hear. I forgot there is a new range of evo rubbers, that is why I though about quantum. Since I am quite satisfied with EL-P I will try EL-S. It shouldn't be much different."
343,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"The EL-S sponge is a little harder in average, the topsheet is softer and even more grippy. The stiff topsheet of EL-P makes it ideal for direct play, EL-S is the rubber for a pretty easy first ball on underspin and everything that follows topspin-wise. So if your next ball is a topspin, go for EL-S, if you open up to enter a game of block and counter stay with EL-P. Which of course is not to say you can´t do everything with both."
344,5f6877a364fe8d59b1ff54f2,tibhar quantum S vs evo EL-P,"I understand your point. EL-P is little bit better for flat hits , active block and counter - that is why I love it. But since I am trying to open the game with first topspin attack EL-S should be more suitable.I will check it out.Thanks again."

365,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"Yes. I haven't tried anything like MX-P or Tenergy. However I think hard rubber/tacky topsheet does what I want it to do, so I don't see how my game would really benefit from top end Euro/Jap rubber based on what I've heard about them. I've played with mid-end and low-end Euro rubber and didn't like them, although they weren't really the best you can get. I'll have to try it for myself to really know, though. Apparently Tenergy is really something."
366,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"To be honest, it really isn't. Should you ever consider trying out a tensor, do yourself a favour and get a Xiom Vega Pro, or a MX-P, something along those lines. Paying the price of a Tenergy is not worth it for a tryout (it's not worth it at all in my opinion, but that's a different topic)On the topic of chinese vs euro/jp.:After thinking about trying out a Hurricane 3 (Neo) for quite some time already I finally had the chance to get my hands on one and give it a shot on a borrowed Eternity VPS. My usual setup is a Maze OFF with 2x EVO EL-S, as you can see on the right. I've tried quite a few euro rubbers, including the Xiom Vega Series, Tenergies, Evo MX-P, Rasant Series and the Hexer series. The only brand I skipped so far was Donic, doesn't really appeal to me for some reason.I'm not gonna go into detail over the advantages of a H3 Neo over a Tensor rubber, but basically I fell in love with the way the chinese rubber plays. It's kind of an all or nothing gamestyle, if you don't move, you won't get anything done. It requires 100% performance at all times and punishes you if you don't deliver the performance.I tried out the rubber without boosting, gonna give it another shot with some Haifu in the near future and see how that affects things.Now I kind of singled out a single rubber out of the ""chinese"" fraction, and for a good reason. If you were to ask me which I prefer out of Hurricane 3 (Neo) and european/japanese Tensor rubbers, the answer is quite clear: Hurricane wins. I've never had this much fun with my forehand.If however the question is chinese vs euro/jp. as stated above, I'd have to go with euro/jp. Simply because a) I didn't try enough chinese rubbers to give a reputable opinion and b) I'm not too fond of the quality control issues which you're more likely to face with chinese rubbers. It's cool to get a sheet for 10 bucks, but if I have to buy 6 of them to get a good one I might as well go with a T05 and at least be able to rely on Butterfly's QC.So yeah, in regards to the forehand, it's as follows: H3 > euro > anything elseI don't really have the technique to slap a rocksolid chinese rubber onto my backhand, so that's kind of out of the question. medium-hard to hard euro/jp rubbers all the way on the BH "
367,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"Since everyone here is stumping for the Chinese rubbers, let me speak out and defend Euro rubbers. Those of us who have physical issues that affect our strokes and make us swing from the shoulder more than we should appreciate Euro rubbers, especially Tenergy. People who don't see anything special in Tenergy need to appreciate how easy it is to spin with it. Whether its price is adequate to justify its performance vs other rubbers is a personal thing, but I know I wouldn't feel as comfortable playing with anything else right now - I know that even my weak strokes are spinny so I will pay for it and just absorb the cost differential. I worked my shoulder to death last year using Chinese rubber and Euro Chinese rubber equivalents. Right now, I am recovering with Tenergy and happily too.Not everyone wants to have a massive forehand where they go all out all the time. Some of us have all round forehands that block as well as loop and may even just roll the ball from distance. For all such forehands, it is good to have Euro rubbers. Even many of the top European players agree as most of them use Euro rubbers despite having world class forehands."
368,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"The way I see it, I'd really love Tenergy, because I think my touch is good enough to just let it do the job for me and produce more spin and speed than I'm normally capable of. However, I'm reasonably fit and young, and I wanna develop my technique, and I'm a cheapass, so I'm gonna root for tacky hard sponge. "

Am I wrong?"
371,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"Let's put it this way, if you have absolutely no idea what you're doing, Tenergies can be a bit of a pain in the ass, it's a fast and bouncy rubber and not easy to control. If you have good touch, it can definitely be a weapon even without good or ""demanding"" technique. If you're really good and can tame the rubber as well as bring a decent technique with you, you're gonna have a lot of fun. But as said before, turns out I have more fun with a Hurricane "

The ones I tried were stated as ""soft"", but still too hard for my liking. My FH swing looks more like chinese then euro play though. I prefer soft rubbers (or at least soft topsheet) to lift the ball and generate as much spin as possible. Perhaps I'm going to give Genesis S a try "
375,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,I play with the Genesis M version and I think it has a good balance between euro and Chinese feel. I think the tackiness in the topsheet feels more lika a chinese rubber but the sponge feels more euro to me. Which is the hardest Chinese rubber on the market?

377,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"Well my experience:1. Service: Chinese rubber generally better for backspin and pendulum serves. Reverse Pendulum is easier for me with European rubbers as you need to give the ball forward momentum. 2. Receive: Drop Shot: If you are early to the ball then Chinese rubbers will help you keep the ball nice and tight. If you are like me and wait an extra millisecond or two to be extra sure what spin is on the ball, then it's easier to push the ball short with European rubbers. Forehand Flicking is easier with chinese rubbers as you can just power through the ball and the ball clings to the rubber. Backhand flicking is easier with softer euro rubbers as the ball can sink into the sponge. You can put more backspin with a chinese rubber on a long push without fear of it going out of the table. 3. Looping over the table is generally easier for me with Chinese rubbers as it is so precise. You can just brush over the ball and loop anything that is slightly long or high. Looping falling balls is easier with European type rubbers. Counterlooping close to the table is easier for me with Chinese rubbers as the ball won't slip through but once you take a step or two back from the table, you have better margins with non-tacky rubbers as well as a safer arc.4. If you are not in position, it's hard to get a good shot out of a tacky rubber as the rubber doesn't have catapult. If you are evading the ball and trying to play a stroke, it's much more likely that you will play a better stroke with Euro-style rubber.5. Smashing is infinitely easier with European type rubbers. On flatter strokes, the tacky topsheet is sensitive to the spin on the ball. Also, you will have to really put a lot of power into the stroke because the ball will come off slower from a tacky rubber.6. Passively blocking is a lot easier for me personally with tacky rubbers compared to harder Euro stuff. I don't know why exactly but it seems like I can get the angle approximately right and the rubber with absorb the spin and speed of the opponent.In the end I decided to use a medium-hard non-tacky rubber on the Forehand. Though I certainly miss blocking and flicking with a tackier rubber, I have less aches after training and the other benefits make it up for me "

If you have never tried them, or ANYTHING like them, what you are talking about is CLEARLY not based on EXPERIENCE. Technically, this IS NOT TRUE. Not true at all. When we got you to face the music that your rubber was dead as a doornail, at the time you kept claiming it was perfect, great rubber that you could get loads of massive spin with. How we showed you the rubber was dead was when I got you to try the ball bounce touch exercise. Should I repost that video? That old, dead, recreational rubber was closer to ANTISPIN than it was to new RECREATIONAL rubber and much closer to the wet side of a banana peel than to Tenergy or MX-P. Refer to the post from Suga D which made me laugh so hard for the simple, more direct version of the message. What you can say that you know is that the 729 rubber you are using is good enough for you and since money is tight and you are on a budget an inexpensive rubber that is still pretty decent is enough for you. And, from a theory standpoint, based on what I know about Tenergy, MX-P and Jurassic Reptiles like the Archosaurus, with Tenergy, you might struggle to get the ball to land on the table for a few weeks. You might not. But it is more likely that you would. Sent from Inside The Chamber of Secrets by Patronus"
380,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"Having a chinese rubber like Hurricane on FH, you actually then looping essentially by using the blade to produce the spin of the ball, that's the whole idea of this hard tacky chinese rubbers. To exert more solid, raw power from the inner core of the blade. And this is why the spin produced by the H3 are so different from the tensors like tenergy if enough power is applied into the ball where you literally almost creating the spin with the blade itself rather than relying on a sponge like it's the case with tenergy where minimal contact is required because of the catapult effect that it has.And btw Mx-P is one of the worst rubbers for my FH I've ever experienced."
381,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"So explain to me then why people boost their chinese rubbers, if the point of a H3 is to create the power with the blade instead of the rubber?I'm not really buying your explanation to be honest "
382,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"In order to add extra power of course. The effect of raw spin created by the core blade is still visible though, even when boosted. That is because of how deeply you can penetrate the ball through using the hard tacky chinese rubber allowing you to use the raw power from the blade more rather than relying on a tensor."
383,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"All the chinese top players use the ""hook"" mechanism to hit the ball when looping using the H3 and hit the ball centrally and not tangentially like for instance Timo Boll does and thus they're able to engage the ball into the blade and use a lot of raw power from the blade. The spin is then totally different. I wish more professional european players would also start using tacky rubbers on the FH and using more hooking mechanism to loop FH like the chinese do and not just a short-stroke like the european/japanese do with their tensors."
384,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,"Sorry but yes, you are wrong. You still need good technique. It may not be exactly the same technique that you need for Chinese rubber. But it still needs to be good if you want a good result. You still need weight transfer. You still need to hit the right part of the ball with good timing, while on balance, etc. etc. on and on. A list of all the things you would need to do to effectively use T05 would be a book on table tennis, best written by real coaches and such. The one thing I was going to say on this thread, which is that kind of early in one's development one is given a certain type of rubber then trains with it for years, then it is going to be really hard to use something quite radically different. So I have found all Chinese rubbers that I have tried pretty bizarre, with the one exception of a guy who showed up once at our club with some Hurricane rubber that had been boosted to the point where it was amazing that it could stay glued to the blade. That was a bit less weird to me, still nothing I would be able to use effectively.But I sure can't argue with the playing level of some people I know who learned to play with Chinese rubbers. Obviously it is not a bad thing -- for them."

I simply like the feel & grip tacky topsheets give.Furthermore, I play close to the table. I don't need more speed or power from the sponge. When I want to hit it hard, there's no problem with speed. If anything, I need something slower to keep me consistent. I've hit with my buddy's Tenergy before and it's fun if messing around like we're both 5 feet of the table rallying. But in actual games I hate it. Ball so often goes long... I'm sure just like pretty much any rubber, one would get use to it in time.So it's a win, win for me. Chinese rubbers feel normal to me and I'm not dropping $70 bucks a sheet. (No offense to those of you who are. It's just not my thing)"

I actually think you are right, and that Tenergy can reward lots of suboptimal technique when looping but you can't defend that position when you haven't used the rubbers before. Most of the players writing to you are thinking from a USATT 1800-2100 perspective and probably don't remember what it was like to use Tenergy at a lower level when they had really bad technique. I kinda do so I know what that ball arc from 05 and Baracuda used to do to my opponents even when my loop sucked."
392,5f6877c064fe8d59b1ff5504,What do you prefer? Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers?,It's fine by me too. Level of play matters when making these statements. Is it possible to play at a high level using this cheaper stuff? Sure. But does the higher level of play do things to this cheaper stuff that most people who play at that level will find value in the more expensive stuff? I think so. People aren't so blind to costs that we spend money blindly.

At least I'm not afraid of looking like I don't have the slightest idea of what I'm talking about. Maybe you've not considered that I might want to try Tenergy later, but it's bloody expensive, so I'm gonna want all the info from all the sources I can get before I invest? Not just the reviews, but more detailed info that might sound a bit redundant, too. Like NL said, it'll probably take me a good deal of time to get used to it, and I might just give up entirely if I don't know what I'm dealing with in the slightest.

(most prefer soft european rubbers) but well you dont have to go for what others prefer but im just recommending a soft one because with BH soft rubbers are catapult like and helps you make the BH a lot easier If you want recommendation for BH rubbers, please provide more info on what type do you want? fast or normal speed? Spinny or just speed? Because from what you said, every rubber is good at flicking and etc it just requires skills so yeh please be more specific Cheers!"
411,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"I played both rubbers and I must say that hurricane 8 is better than 3 neo on hard varnished blades. Neo works good on flexible blades, also this rubber maintain much longer tackiness than hurricane 8."
412,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"I had them both on ZJK ALC and wood blades, H3 (the commercial version) on ZJK ALC was a disaster specially in the short game, very sensitive to incoming spin. It was a bit better on wood blade but I didn't play with it for longer times. H8 on the other hand was better on both blades. However, and I'm not sure if this a good thing or not, both requires a perfect stroke and more effort (a large hand swing). the downside is that I lost many matches because of that but the positive side of the story is that it made things easier when I revert back to european rubbers, I might even say it accelerated my development in FH topspin."
413,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"iamvtwo, thanks for your reply. I am currently using the hurricane 2 on my FH so i have experienced the hard rubber etc. and I would like to upgrade cuz I don't feel like it is very consistent with its trajectory and the speed isnt good enough. A for the backhand rubber, I am looking for a softer sponge which can spin well and can create power and spin when needed - many gears. I like to open the game up with a fairly quick flick and after that the shots with the backhand will mostly be close to the table(powerful) or mid range(controlled), never far away. I read somewhere that many pros are using non-tacky or very un-tacky rubbers on their backhand but seeing as i've only used tacky rubbers i'm a bit wary to how it will play. Tenergy is quite popular on the backhand but slightly too expensive, could u suggest any for cheaper?At the moment I'm using a stiga infinity vps v as my blade.Musaab, are you saying that a bigger stroke is needed when using the hurricane 8? Do you know what the pros an cons are to both rubbers e.g. where it excels (close to the table or ....).Thanks for the replies!"
414,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Stiga Genesis S for your backhand- i have posted review on here to read
415,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"I'm no expert by any means , I play close mid-range myself which I assume you do the same, I think we have the same style since I like to open by a chiquita (flip) on my backhand too. With time I adapted to both Hurricanes but one problem always been there , lifting backspin , always extremly difficult and when I play against a defender it is just the mission impossible. If you are somehow satisfied by H2 and you want an upgrade, H8 is more consistent in my opinion. for the backhand I used to play with T80 FX and T64, it was quite fun, however blocking heavy spin is kinda difficult with the spring sponge. I recently came accross these Tibhar Aurus variations (sound and soft) and I like it alot, light weight rubbers with very decent power and feeling. rememeber Tenergies and hurricanes are somewhat heavy."
416,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Hi Sakumi,what is your setup at the moment?Wooden or composite blade?For me, the H3 Neo (39 deg prov.) suits my playing style in combine with the ALC blade.Since the rubber quite heavy, it's better to choose rather heavier blade >90g.It depends also on your technique; european technique should use softer sponge eg. Hurricane 8 or Hurricane 3-50.For BH rubber I would suggest DHS Skyline 3-60."
417,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Well if you want an upgrade to your H2, H8 or 3Neo would both be a good choice.But well i would say H3 or H3Neo would be a better upgrade if you're used to H2 When compared H3 neo and H8, the H8 is slightly softer and has less tackiness so that's mean less spinny than H3 neo and also that means it gives you a bit more of control when playing even if you just start to use it H3 neo would be close to H2 just that its a lot faster and low ball trajectory. So, i would say H3 neo would be a better choice but well you can have a try with H8 you might like it better who knows? As for your BH, From what you described above i think Tibhar Evolution MX-S or MX-P would be great and it is similar to Tenergy 05 but doesnt mean its the same as T05..the feelings and touch is of course different from t05 as this is a medium hard rubber and its jus that the spin and speed of this rubber matches and is similar to the t05. Most people choose it because it is similar to T05 and is half the price of T05 with much more durability. Im currently using Omega V Pro and it is also similar to T05 in my point of view but it is slightly slower and less spinny but it has an incredible good control with high arc that helps to reduce errors or reduce hitting the ball into the net. Well it worth the try and im actually liking it. **Also about the H8 and bigger stroke, there is no need to do a bigger stroke with H8 or full body stroke thats just what the chinese pro players does but i wouldnt recommend you to do so the chinese pro players do it because they were trained and used to that playing style but if you do it it will be a disaster because you dont have the reflexes like them, you cant recover for the next shot because you're not used to it and it requires incredible footwork to do so. SO IF YOU WANT TO DO THE FULL BODY STROKES LIKE THE PRO CHINESE PLAYERS, YOU NEED TO WORK REALLY HARD ON YOUR FOOTWORK AND ATHLETICISM***"
418,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"LIKE I TOLD YOU IN MY FIRST POST, you need to provide me with more info on the type of rubber you preferLooking at pro players equipments is good but you should look for whats good for you rather than looking whats the pro uses and try to use it For example: Tenergy, I used tenergy for about 3 months but its not for me The rubber is too soft for me and it is really hard to adapt to these kind of rubber after using harder rubbers You see tenergy is not for everyone. and you requires a lot of skills in order to use it.Sorry to say this but i can already imagine you struggling using Tenergy after using a hard rubber on BH because it was the same for me. So, for now, for your BH, if you want a really fast rubber with medium amount of spin go for Stiga rubbers Stiga rubbers are really fast but kinda lacks in control but you'll get use to it in a short amount of time If you want a control with medium fast and medium spin, i would say try out Xiom Omega V Pro that im using It would worth your try and check out TTD channel on YouTube and check out their rubber reviews videos or search for reviews on specific rubbers in the equipment reviews i bet that will help you a lot Cheers! Good Luck!"
419,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,IMO the difference between the two is the technique or approach. If you like to loop the ball hard or spin the table that is H3 on the other hand H8 requires a more relaxed approach and really fine brushing if you loop the ball hard this is where I notice the slippage. The H8's sponge is more active than the H3 so expect it to be bouncier and one thing I noticed is that the H8 is comparable to a H3 provincial especially the higher quality of topsheet and the active sponge. Lifting backspin is easy in H3 chinese style stroke and even easier in H8 if you can maximize the tacky topsheet and the active sponge. Next week I'm gonna go back to H3 because the H8's slippage on hard shots is really annoying. 
420,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Roger, currently I'm using the stiga infinity vps v which is a wooden blade...I think. On my FH I'm using the H2, which is what I'm mainly looking to upgrade, and the friendship/729 Higher 3 on my backhand which is quite good. I was just wondering what other people were using which could influence my decision for a BH rubber in the future.Thanks for the detailed reply iamvtwo. I did use tenergy 05 on my friend's bat for about 30 mins and tbh I found it really hard to control the trajectory of the ball due to it being very soft. The Tibhar Evolution MX-P and Xiom Omega V Europe looks very interesting. I will consider them both in the future when I want to replace my old one.From reading all the comments about H3 neo and H8, I'm starting to lean towards the H3 just due to the precise stroke and technique you have to use (Sometimes my stroke can be off) as well as it sounds like the H3 is more direct in the positioning of shots. I have been looking at chinese players equipment because I feel a closer resemblance to their playstyle and I have realised that all have chosen the H3 over the H8 (disregarding different edition like national). Why is this?"

422,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"Sakumi, I would stay using tacky chinese rubbers, since you're already familiar with them. The modern ESN rubbers (Tibhar Evolution, Xiom ) are quite different to play.The chinese rubbers are also not expensive. Why don't you try H3 Neo first for the FH? I would suggest you to get the 39 deg sponge first to feel the difference (Try first the commercial one here: http://ttnpp.com/store/dhs/277-neo-d...abeling-6.html )H8 uses different sponge, more like european one. Too soft and mushy for meEspecially with the 40+ balls, tacky chinese rubbers can produce more spin (with the right technique)"
423,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,Do you know any websites that allow you to select the degrees other than that website? It will take 3 weeks for it be delivered.

424,5f6877d964fe8d59b1ff5514,Hurricane 3 neo vs Hurricane 8,"The difference is very high, counter topspins even against tenergy rubber.Besides you'll have a very good control short game ( serve, return of serve, ball placement ...), But keep in mind that these rubbers are NOT suitable for smashing, only for thin brushing top spin with the forward movement and wrist snapping. Unfortunately this is the only website for the commercial H3 Neo with sponge degree selection that I know."

Sigma 2 euro first of has a softer sponge and overall softer feel. I don't think the throw angles are very different, but mx-p might be slightly higher. MX-P is a bit heavier.

439,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,"Rising Dragon is a chinese rubber. It's probably classed as a hybrid because it's semi-tacky (topsheet looks very much like yinhe big dipper) rather than full-on tacky like a classic H3, and its sponge is modern and porous (I could believe it if someone said it was a japanese sponge - it's really nice) rather than rock-hard and solid.If you wanted to experiment with a move from ESN to chinese than Rising Dragon is a good one to try out for sure, but it's pretty expensive for what it is.A cheaper option - I've recently got hold of a sheet of Sanwei Target National (blue sponge). It's cheaper than Rising Dragon but is along the same lines - semi-tacky and porous sponge - and I wonder if they come from the same factory. I haven't had chance to try it out yet but the sponge looks really similar, while the topsheet feels similarly tacky but is a fair bit softer."

442,5f68781f64fe8d59b1ff553c,Yasaka Rising Dragon vs Chinese tacky rubbers,"I have played with Rising Dragon once. The rubber is not very tacky, meaning that it much more felt as tensors rubber like Mark-V. Yes, it says hybrid on description but it is simply a combination of tensors with slight tackiness. Therefore, you have less spinny serves than those super-tacky Chinese rubbers. However, the good thing about Rising Dragon is that it is much controllable than chinese rubbers.In my opinion, I do not think Rising Dragon can replace boosted chinese rubbers."

The 999 series of rubbers are excellent and used to be far more popular than Hurricane.

The difference in technique is too great and you'll eventually return to T05 after a long and expensive experimental journey. I've seen it happen many times."

478,5f68784364fe8d59b1ff5552,globe 999 national vs dhs hurricanes and skylines,"Denizyilmaz, i haven't seen you play yet, but if you use the same technique on tacky rubbers like you've been using for your tenergy, then it's no big surprise you didn't get more spin from the big dipper. I think that is kind of what tinykin meant. You have to change/adjust your technique to make these tacky rubbers shine.To make tacky rubbers excel it recquires a full arm swing stroke with a very brushing contact of the ball.Most people that use temergies and tensors don't do this kind of swing, but instead it's more of a underarm/half arm swing than full arm and engaging more the sponge, whereas with a full arm swing you rather engage the topsheet.You can try to get the tackiest rubber like friendship 729 origin or friendship 729 origin soft and most likely still won't get better results (MORE SPIN!! I guess that is what you're after) If you don't adjust your technique...There have been so many threads and vids on this forum about this topic already. I think i've found one that fits.

Less sensitive to incoming spin? Slower more spinny? Most similar but just diferent? Anything you're having a hard time doing with Tenergy 05? or any other thoughts?

491,5f68790d887afbc97df83859,Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers. What are the key differences?,"Can you explain what you mean by mechanical spin? (I think you mean spin which is generated by the stroke mechanics rather than grazing the ball and using a lot of wrist, ie topsheet spin). Also which brands of rubbers are Japanese?"
492,5f68790d887afbc97df83859,Chinese Rubber vs European Rubbers. What are the key differences?,"butterfly is a typical japanese rubber brand, a lot of euro moddern rubbers are all made in the same factory with the same technology (ESN) like tibhar, donic, joola, andro and even xiom from korea. the topsheet is grippy and it grabs the ball through friction while the sponge produces most of the spin. this means the ball has to sink deep into the rubber if you want to produce a powerful loop.chinese rubbers have a sticky (tacky) topsheet so they grip the ball even without it sinking deep into the rubber. however, they also have a harder sponge compared to euro/jap rubbers. a harder sponge rubber has more potential to produce power but you have to commit to the shot and put a lot of power into it or the result will be poor.it can get tricky when looking at brands because some chinese brands have euro type rubbers (LKT Pro XP) and some euro brands have chinese type rubbers (Donic Akkadi Taichi)."

From a technical point of view also, using a Chinese rubber you have to brush the ball more to produce the spin and accuracy on the table. Whereas a Euro rubber you can go more forward and the rubber naturally grabs the ball producing spin as you contact. This is what I have found when I go from a Japanese rubber to a Chinese Tacky rubber."

506,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,"You might actually be better off taking those rubbers and putting them on a slower, all wood blade for a few weeks or months before going back up to your old setup. Theoretically it should work fine either way, but that blade is fast and hard because of the carbon. If you got something like a Primorac Off- or a Petr Korbel and used it with the same rubbers for a while, once you got your touch back you can just go back to the old blade and it won't be much of an adjustment because you were using the same rubbers on a blade that is slower with more control. But if you change the rubbers to Sriver or Mark V then you will still have an adjustment for the rubbers and rubbers like Sriver or Mark V on a TB ALC is a bit weird."

508,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,Could it be possible that he's having trouble controlling the sensitivity of spin that Baracuda might have instead of the speed? It's supposed to be one of the spinniest rubbers ever and perhaps it's just reacting to everything like crazy.

511,5f687951887afbc97df83885,Baracuda vs coppa x1 gold vs rakza 7,Baracuda is the most spinny rubber lve used. It is very easy to control during topspin to topspin rallies. Very good for controlled looping and you can also hit the ball hard when needed. But the rubber is not that fast and is a little bit soft. I would recommend this rubber on the backhand.I never used any rubbers of the coppa series so I cant review them.Rakza 7 has also good spin not as much as baracuda but I think it comes close to Tenergy 05. It has good touch in my opinion. Some people say its too bouncy but they probably have a bad touch. Its a very good rubber for flicking short balls. The only problem I found with this rubber is that when you try to hit the ball flatter and harder on the topspins you have less controll about where the ball goes. It work good on smashing high lobs but when they lob the ball lower you have to make a bit of a brushing action when smashing. so Ill rate the rubbers 1-10 on each point.Baracuda;Spin; 9.5Speed; 7 (8 on harder and faster blades)Hardness; 4.5Controll; 8.5Rakza 7;Spin; 9Speed; 9Hardness; 6.5Controll; 8So I would recommend Baracuda if your more of a slow looper that relies on spin and controll above speed.I recommend Rakza 7 when if you like to loop with power.

513,5f687953887afbc97df83886,Chinese vs Euro rubbers,"Chinese rubbersFor me, I love using chinese rubbers on my forehand side, especially Hurricane 3 Neo. Chinese rubbers are hard and tacky (not when you move to Provincial or even National series). They produce whole lots of spin when you play your stroke. Some say they are slow and dead, the main thing is you should develop your stroke as the speed is all about your stroke. Chinese rubbers are best paired with flexible blade. I've read most of the article by those chinese, they like to pair Hurricanes with Stiga's blade such as OC and Yinhe MC2. If you're a flat hitter, look for others but if you're mainly winning points by looping (either open ups or power looping) and close to the table, Chinese rubbers suit you best.Euro rubbers.For these, I'll break into two: Euro and Japanese (they act differently though)I used Euro rubbers on my backhand, because they are tensored. As your backhand movement should be more compact than your forehand stroke, a tensor Euro can help you to compensate it. When I first used Euro rubbers on forehand, they act really weird because I'm used to Chinese rubbers. Generating spin require accurate timing as you need the ball to sink into the sponge. In the short game, they are really bouncy but they shines when you go for med-long distance looping. They are more forgiving for some of the people. They had more catapult effect when compared to Chinese rubbers.Japanese rubbersWell, I'm planning to change my Vega Elite to Rakza 7 (backhand). From what I know, Japanese rubbers are just like hybrids for Euro and Chinese. Generating spin is easier and it is not as fast as Euro rubbers (a few steps below them). They emphasize on control and spin."

I have another friend who has a Rosewood V NCT and it feels pretty good on that as well. Everyone is different. For me, I can get the ball to sink into the topsheet and sponge and really spin the ball well with my backhand when I am using 05FX. It feels really good for flipping and has amazing control for blocking. On my blade, when I am blocking someone whose loops are erratic (change of spin, speed and/or placement) I will turn to my 05FX for blocking because of how much control it has and how I can slow the ball down if I want to, when I block with it."
522,5f687965887afbc97df83892,backhand advice T05fx vs. T64,"Hi BS. I saw your post on mytt as well. Here is my advice. I have played with T64 on my BH for almost 3 season now and have tried many other rubbers incl. T05FX. As many other people already mentioned T64 have lower throw than other Tenergy's and the T64 grips the ball more due to the larger pimple distance. This make the rubber great at BH flipping. The bounciness you can't avoid with the Tenergy series but it is something you can adjust to.When playing the T64 it need a high load to ""activate"" the rubbers potential which make the rubber great when push blocking. Due to the low throw you can keep the blocks low."

Im gonna try T64 first because I can get it a little bit cheaper and if it doesnt work well, Im gonna try the T05fx.

535,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,The Mark V is too old. Most people here will suggest it for beginners. I'd suggest taking a step forward and purchasing a tensor.
536,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,"I played with markV 2.0mm for more then 2 or 3 years,in speed glue era.It was one of the most controlled rubbers i played with at time,in any stance.For the game of nowadays,i would recommend Aurus normal version or if you can afford it,an andro rasant,just heard well of it,and both seem pretty similar in most ways.Both of them got great control and pretty good spin and speed.Good for loopers and allround players,with an agressive feeling.Tacky rubbers got something like glutinosity on topsheet,which normally is better to ""grab"" the ball better,being mostly used for loopers and choppers.As for the tackiest rubber, look at DHS Hurricane, Skyline and Haifu Blue Whale rubbers.The advantage that tacky rubbers have is that the rubber will grip the ball at more extreme angles than non tacky rubbers will.It is generally a little slower and can provide slow loops with heavy spin.Also,the ones i mentioned are pretty cheaper then Aurus,tensors can be a good choice,but still pricy.Tacky rubbers need a better technique and an more athletic physic-state when for fast-hard looping,since they are not that fast with only arm movement,they need the body to put strenght on it,while non-tacky are easier to generate speed,cuz the sponge is softer then chinese tacky ones,and normally the topsheets too.Hope i've helped."

541,5f6879e6887afbc97df838f1,DHS Memo 2 vs Yasaka Mark V,I have Memo 2 FH and TNT BH on a DHS carbon cpen CW-D. Not sure of their individual weight but the whole setup is a heavy 192g. I also have Mark V FH and R7 BH on a YEO which weight 180g. Memo 2 has a medium hard sponge not far from Neo TG3. Top sheet is non-tacky but grippy similar to Mark V. Memo 2 gives a nice bounce and great spin. Hard sponge and non-tacky top sheet may not be good for slow topspin that you prefer. I get more feedback from the soft Mark V on YEO than Memo 2 on a fast carbon blade. Worth a try for the low price.
542,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,Are they National version rubbers or commercial version that you can get for example from ttnpp for ~$20?
543,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"they are commercial ! can u send me a internet shop which sells national blue sponge ? i believe tha word ""national"" is purely marketing and it definetely doesnt worth it to pay 40 $ more for something that is only 5 % better...besides chinese pros order rubbers especially tuned for them so its no use to buy ""national"" rubber.'"
544,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,Email me the shop too
545,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,come on people ! no one has ever played with these rubbers ?!
546,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"Ok. I have not not own this rubbers. But i tried them before. Let's compare h3 neo Nat orange sponge and h3 neo national blue sponge, blue sponge tend to be slower and more spin and speed whereas for the orange spobgeis versi-versa. But if you are buying the $26USD special sponge 22# h3 or skyline neo commercial. Don't think about it, reviews have shown that it is even slower than commercial orange sponge ones and it would only be amazing if you use speed glue for the 22# sponge commercial version Hope you understand :x"
547,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"""slower and more spin and speed""I'm sorry, but ... what?"
548,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"Ok, firstly. National versions of everything: prott.ccSecondly, I have used Skyline 3 (TG3) Blue Sponge extensively and have had experience using Hurricane 3 (H3) Blue Sponge. The following experience is completely without boost. The TG3 is spinnier and better on the short to mid-table play as it has a softer sponge it has better feel and hence better touch. The H3 is noticeably faster and it is far better at away from the table looping ""a la"" the top Chinese guys. Thirdly, the blue sponge versions are NOT slower than the orange sponge versions. They are most definitely faster albeit not very noticeable because like most Chinese rubbers the ball only moves as fast as you hit.Lastly, both TG3 and H3 will last around 2-3 months of 10 hours a week play before completely ""falling off the cliff"" in terms of performance. Make sure you take good care of them and cover them when you're not playing. After they die, you can still use them for another month or so with speed glue. This is actually better than the orange sponge version which lasts a little less long."
549,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"Pretty interesting. I'm considering right now to get the TG3 blue sponge commercial on TTNPP or a H3 neo BS provincial maybe a little cheaper than on prott... The problem is that the TG3 BS is 39° and softer (more like 37°/38°) than H3 neo orange sponge provincial also 39°. I am using the H3N right now in 39° with dianchi and I find it just a bit too soft when boosted. I think I might prefer the 40° hardness.. TTFrenzy: I think you're right about the pretty weak differences between Com, Prov and Nat. But I think you're mistaking about the CNT getting their H3N/TG3 already boosted. There is even a video where you can see Ma Lin and Wang LiQin using Haifu Oil ! But even if I didn't know this video, I'd still be convinced: I am sure that they either boost their sheets themselves or (most likely) have it done by a small staff at the CNT training center that prepare the rubbers with Dianchi, Haifu Oil or whatever it is (after all, what proof have we that they really use Dianchi ? excepting Prott trying to make a quick buck by saying the product is used by chinese top-players...? One thing is for certain: they DO boost, but with what) for the whole crew or at least for the 5 top-players, or just the ones who prefer having it done by a staff member instead of doing it themselves."
550,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,do you know where I can buy DHS Skyline TG3 (No. 21 Blue Sponge) Onine?
551,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"ttnpp sells Blue sponged DHS. i bought mine(tg3BS) and was very happy with it it plays great untuned , close to the table, then i tuned it with falco long boost( very heavy tune. it lasted nearly a year tuned). once tuned it was more of an alway from the table rubber but still easy to use"
552,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"HiI have also played with Skyline 3 blue sponge and it is my favorite rubber, but I got bubbles on the topsheet of 3 of my rubbers so I have to stop using them. I boost my rubbers, and think it is a little strange that the durability of the topsheet is so bad, I assume that the blue sponge is created for speedgluing and yet the topsheet breaks down. I have played with all the commercial Hurricanes and skylines and I think the blue sponge are softer, faster, more elastic and lighter. Well I don´t know if its the topsheet or the gluing of the topsheet, but if I boost the H3 yellow sponge it never happens maybe the topsheet on blue sponge don´t stick togheter with the sponge when they glue it togheter with the topsheet."
553,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,strange mine was boosted loads but is still going strong apart from some rips there and there
554,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,"TTFrenzy I thought I'd add my point of view here.When we talk about ""National"" version Blue Sponge it is the highest quality controlled rubber that DHS provides and it is given to the Chinese National Team. The next highest quality rubbers are given to the Provincial teams and then the rest are sold commercially.Basically speaking all rubbers are made in facilities located in Germany, Japan, Korea or China. It doesn't matter what brand it is they are usually made in one of these manufacturing facilities. This means that the topsheets are typically comprised of the same rubbers, but the pips structures and sponges are made with different processes to provide the different feeling.All rubber is created from a very large sheet. I'm talking (and I don't know what the actual measurements are, but you will understand the concept from this example) about as large as a TT Table so let's say 9x5 feet. The center of these rubbers have the highest quality control because they are the least likely to ripple or become different than the further out you go (Think pie crust when you roll it the center is always perfect but the further out you go it is usually worse) Each rubber is cut and then stamped with the different names and then tuned if necessary. The different degrees of hardness I believe depend on the entire sheet's degree of hardness, but typically the center is always the hardest and the further out you go the less hard it is. That is why commercial rubbers are always a little different from each other.National versions are made to a player's specifications. Usually this means they are very hard and then the player will boost it to provide the proper softness feeling they prefer whether 42 degree like Wang Liqin and Ma Long or 40 degree like say Zhang Ji Ke or Xu Xin. Provincial players will usually ask for 38 degree or 39 degree which is why they are much more common. This also means they will be boosting a bit less because it is already softer than the more CNT preferred 40 + degrees. I think it is safe to say that Provincial players just don't hit as hard as the CNT players do which is why they are not in the CNT.So to answer your questions I would have to say that blue sponge typically has more catapult than the orange sponge. The Neo sponge is pretuned which makes it different than the Blue sponge but the topsheets are the same.And as for your other questions because you're using Commercial it is hard to tell because they are not perfect examples of what the rubbers are supposed to be like. here's a thread that I posted about what the rubbers are supposed to be like.http://www.tabletennisdaily.co.uk/fo...e-Sponge/page2"

566,5f6879fa887afbc97df838fd,Hurricane 3 blue sponge vs skyline 3 blue sponge,kinda pointless adding your site there since you dont have any blue sponged rubbers like the ones mentioned above
567,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"i havent... i chop with hurricane 3 (normal, commercial), and find it very spinny..so cant really help, sorry...i found generally, when i attacked, the softer the rubber, the faster it is. although obviously most soft rubber produce a lot of spin too.i find the chinese rubbers are generally very tacky and good for spinning though, and h3 is one of the best, so im not a lot of help...sorrry :/perhaps its just a duff sheet."
568,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"it comes down to technique with the rubber differences. because H3 has a very hard sponge, there is not alot of time that the ball is contacting it before it is off the rubber. you need more brushing of the ball to get more spin, and not going through the ball as much as before. cant say for sure without seeing, or for that matter feeling what you are doing.but i think the issue definitely comes down to developing a better feel for touch and brushing the ball.but im no expert, im just thinking physics wise that's what makes sense :] hope that helped"
569,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I can copy that. The harder the sponge is, the more you need to work on your touch. While it is easier to generate a certain amount of spin with softer rubbers you can get a lot more spin with the H3 due to its tacky rubber, but, as already mentioned, you have to improve your ""touch"".It is the same thing, when deciding the thickness of the sponge. Maximum generates more speed and spin but needs a cleaner technique than thinner sponges."
570,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Well, yes and no, depends on what blade you use. If you are playing a hard sponge on a very flexy blade, the hard sponge will really engage the blade flex and as a result, your racket will have plenty dwell. A soft rubber on the same racket, will typically not engage the blade flex as much, so you get more dwell from the rubber but much less dwell from the blade. (Soft rubber will take much of the ball's impact energy, and use it to catapult the ball, so much the energy gets dissipated in the sponge. Hard dead sponges let most of the impact energy push the rubber into the blade, so if the blade is flexy, you get dwell and catapult from the blade instead of the rubber.)I play a very flexy blade with hard rubber on the forehand and soft on the backhand, and this effect is very noticeable if I twiddle. (I twiddle when I EJ my soft backhand rubber and I'm curious of how it plays on the forehand.)"
571,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," i agree, just speaking in general terms, the harder the sponge, the more Brush/touch you need in your stroke to get the most out of it"
572,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Sponge hardness is a topic that is often misunderstood. Various amounts of spin & speed are produced on the ball depending on several factors...These factors are1)Dwell time (mostly related to spin but in soft rubbers it creates speed also) 2)Power of the stroke (related to spin & spin also, the harder the hit the faster the ball, the harder the brush the spinnier the ball)3)Tehcnique timing & angle of the stroke that also produce different amounts speed & spinSome physics to understand betterThere are two forces on the ball a) the tangential one that creates spin b)and the lateral one that creates speedNotice that by the term speed we mean horizontal speed not vertical! The actual result of these two forces is that the ball is travelling spinny and speedy creating an arc.Lets assume that a table tennis sponge is like a spring . Hard springs when compared to softer ones when fully compressed produce more force thus more acceleration (F= K X A , Newton's law) thus more speed, to the object that compresses them. K is the modulus of elasticity of the spring=sponge, F the Force , A fore accelerationConclusion no1 : When the sponge is hard you need strong hitters to manage to compress the sponge at its full in order to take full advantage of its abilities ! To achieve that you need a hard hitter with perfect timing and angle of the racket. Like any chinese professional player for example...doesnt have to be top10. That doesnt mean that if you are in good physical condition with fast footwork and good body & wrist rotation (but not a pro player) you cant play effectively with a chinese rubber.Conclusion no2 : With softer sponges (the sponge has more ""porosity"") you need less power and have big margin for error in your angle of your strokes to achieve a desired arc (speed&spin). Because of the softness, the ball compresses easily the sponge at its full potential giving you & me and the whooole TTdaily forum amateur players an easy task!Conclusion no3 : Knowing the importance of timing, paddle angle and sponge hardness, underspins lifted with hard rubbers need perfect technique and timing compared to the soft ones. A heavy underspin if lifted with a small error in technique using a soft rubber, maybe will not be lifted (or lifted with less pace & arc) with a hard rubber. BUT when you learn your technique correctly and learn to lift every underspin ball with ease, using hard rubbers will give you more effective shotsSo...If you have good technique footwork and physique you can play with a hard tacky rubber like the hurricane (boosted of course...chinese rubbers were invented to be boosted) . If you are a beginner who still is improving his shots prefer a soft rubber.p.s. Notice that conclusion1&2&3 are considering the exact same stroke with the exact same incoming ball to your paddle."
573,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"T-11 is a fast blade, and won't hold the ball nearly as long as a typical pre-made racket. (These are usually allround-style 5-ply rackets which have lots of dwell.) I think this is the main problem."
574,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Read my previous post if you like  It is rather unlikely that the 729 FX produces more spin that the hurricane. Maybe you feel that way because it is softer thus giving you more feedback in your palm.Of course the fact that you have an OFF+ blade plays an important role in the dwell time of the blade...pre made paddles are very slow compared to custom ones. So they have more dwell time=more spin
575,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,what a great post.

592,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers," The point is, what is the best blade for a given individual player? You say you play 1-2 hours? sessions? every 2 weeks. I know a guy who used to have pretty good control with his Timo Boll Spirit, but now he can only practice 2-4 hours a week, so it was difficult for him to maintain the technique needed for his offensive blade. So now he's using a slower blade.Like Yosua says, your 5$ premade blade might be better for players like you and me. The 729 premade blades are actually pretty decent quality blades in the 5-ply all-wood allround class.With time I'm sure you can get used to the T-11+ if you really want to. But you will need to be patient and you will need to accept that this kind of fast blade won't be very forgiving of your mistakes. And then it's up to you if you want fast speed & difficult placement control & more mistakes (T-11+), or less speed & easier placement control & less mistakes (slower blade)."

But i wouldnt worry about heavy rubber. I im 5' 7"" and weigh like 110. and im using what is considered a quite heavy rubber, once u adjust its fine, just depending on how hard you play, watch out for carpel tunnel in the wrist, or tennis elbow. you can get both of these with light rubber as well, just be more aware of it."

I used to play european rubbers until I discovered those 2 and I haven't tried out any other.Maybe that's why our opinion differs about it's tackiness.Also neither my H3 nor the Skyline have lost their tackiness (even after 1-2 month's). I just have to breath onto it and swipe the humidity from it and ist nearly as tacky as new (or use some water).I have never boosted the topsheet since I heard, that it wouldn't work. John_Pish said, that he had done it and it worked. Maybe you'll try it out. But as I said, I've only heard about unsatisfying results...But boosting the rubber is something completely different. As already mentioned, they used to glue with speedglue. This is now forbidden so manufacturers have come up with ""boosters"". They are not glue, so you still have to glue your rubbers with some VOC free glue. But since it's pretty hard (or even impossible?) to reveal that somone has boosted, most of the pro's do it.These boosters add some spice to your blade (but still illegal). They make your rubbers faster, spinnier and they feel a lot softer. You can search for it in this forum or in google. There's quite a lot about it.If you miss a certain feel in your game you could try out a different wood. The internetz is really not your best friend when it comes to reviews or hints about finding your new set-up. It is something very personal. Maybe you should search a local dealer and go there to try some stuff out before bying. That's what I always do. Don't rush it and especially don't let other people tell you what is better for you.My first custom blade was some andro carbon. It was really really crap. No ""feeling"", nothing. But it was fast -> so my smashes were cool. But that was the end of the story Then I bought the Tibhar Samsonov Alpha (it's still quite cheap ~30 € here). It was one of the best wooden blades I ever had. And now I have another (faster) all wood blade, which I bought after more than 1 month comparing. Carbon was just wrong for me.In conclusion: Try it out! "
604,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I had this problem with the T11+ using hard rubbers and I have 2 T11+ setups, Setup1- DHS H3 Neo(FH) and DHS Tin Arc3(BH) then I changed to Xiom Vega Europe Max(FH) and Xiom Omega 4 Elite Max (BH) . I am now more than happy as these 2 rubbers are soft and combine very well with the Stiff and fast T11+. Setup 2 which I bought later is Butterfly Solcion (FH) and I kept the DHS Tin Arc 3(BH) which good for blocking and BH push as it is a none tacky rubber.I think most definitely the soft rubbers on T11+ is very good for me."
605,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,do you have an H3?can you take a picture of it?here is a picture of mine after a few hours of usehttp://i.imgur.com/a1TN4L1.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/tPCyraE.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/FrBDN2t.jpgI do not find it as glossy as my other teamates old rubbers and when I press my finger against the rubber I barely feel the tackiness.
606,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,Trying out different set ups would cost huge amount of cash and as a student I don't make much.
607,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I took the decision to stop using H3 ( I have no photo I afraid) as it needs a lot of energy and technique to make it work properly so my H3 rubbers were in good state but gave them to my fellow players who could master them. I have much more control with my actual rubbers be it soft touch or strong top spins/smashes. I have a much more varied strokes now. I think the Galaxy T11+ is such a rocker of a blade.
608,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Why would it cost? Is there no opportunity in the shops?I walk into the shop (preferably with a friend). Tell them what i would like to try out. They glue it on a blade of my choice and me and my friend try them out. They have several tables there. As you see, I don't buy them. They are ""test-blades"".I'm a student as well. The shop also has something which you can translate as ""test-bag"". For a little fee 0.50€ each rubber/blade or something like that you can choose 8 or 9 pieces and you can try them out. You have 6 weeks to decide. Then you give it back. If you liked something you can buy it (of course you'll get a new rubber, not the one you and other have been testing) and then you won't even have to pay the fee."
609,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,then wipe it with a damp sponge.... these rubbers are tacky therefore they pick up dust very easily.... so even when you are playing it helps to... breathe/spit on the rubber and wiping it on your shorts
610,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Hi Blue,Things are not that easy in Mauritius, as we do not have specialized shops selling Table Tennis goods, it only the web which contains a great choice of blades and rubbers.We are guided by great TT forums like this one and equipment reviews."
611,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,I'm afraid there isn't such a system in my country. It's like you go to the shop choose your racket and that's it.

613,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I do wipe it after a few mins of use but as many are saying H3 is very tacky, I played a few people today and had a feel of their rubber and I could feel the tackiness more on their old rubber than on my new H3."
614,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Yeah right mate!Just save for some soft rubbers such as Butterfly Solcion,Xiom Omega 4 Elite, Vega Europe as I listed above and you wont go wrong.They are long lasting rubbers as well compared to chinese ones"

617,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Oh yeah right mate. I'm sorry.Well then it seems like you have something you like anyway. Many friends of mine play with XIOM Vega Elitea and Europe. They are pretty good and they are cheaper than butterfly (at least here). I often buy rubbers for them. F.e. the XIOM Vega Elite or Europe cost me ~ 24,- €.How are the prices over there in Mauritius?"
618,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"its around 25-40 usd for xiom if you know where to look. skip vega europe.. its garbage... also nothing is long lasting compared to chinese rubbers.. fact. xiom tent to have pretty weak( structurally ) topsheets. bty somewhat stronger.also about that pic.. they will be about the same tackyness = or - here and there, but you wont need to worry about it.... i would only advice on H3 if your arms are strong.. if you can accelerate your swing pretty fast.. if you cant get TG3 or skip the likes of hurricanes if you swing about as fast as this get skyline.."

625,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I think what has been said is that that is a very fast blade. Too Fast.If you are finding the Hurricane not tacky, either you need to clean it more frequently, which is a problem with Hurricane. It is tacky enough that it gets covered with dust and stops gripping the ball. Or, you have yourself a fake, which is possible. There are a lot of counterfeits out there. If it is a real Hurricane then technique is a good part of the answer as stated above. If it is not a real Hurricane then, unfortunately, you may have been swindled."
626,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"It is too bad you read reviews and got something for yourself that was not really right for you. Having a coach or a professional player who knows equipment see your game and recommend a setup that would be right for your needs is ideal. Unfortunately, not everyone has access to that kind of information. So you tried to do your best with on line reviews and, it sounds like, you ended up with a blade that may be too fast and a rubber that is not working for your game. How does the backhand rubber feel to you? Is that side at least okay?"
627,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"what carl said, yeah when you attack,the thing is you everyone can swing fast once but can you follow up and keep doing it with accuracy and spinyeah stay away from carbon blades with huricanes .. they dont really like it hard semi flexi blades is what you want.in my opinion( because ive tried)Yasaka MEO + H3 will do for mid some far away from tableMEO + TG3 will work better for far away, but wont be as spinny as h3Rosewood + H3 , i couldnt get it to work from far away that well so best at close to mid distance from tableRosewood + Tg3( blue sponge) works from close to far away from tableHurricane hao + tg3 ispretymuch same as the rosewood option but with more dwell( more controll)Hurricane hao + h3 same as above you will need god power in your arms to make it work far off the tablebut saying that a fresh hurricane 3 neo or provincial feels so good on Hurricane hao .. and with intermediate technique will be easy enough to use the better your technique the more you can get out of your equipment"

636,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"I believe that there is a number on the sponge side of the sheet that you can type in, on a DHS web-site and the DHS website will but tried to check."
637,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,well mine isn't boosted but it can't do that
638,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,"Should be able to do that regardless of whether it is boosted or not. Boost affects the sponge and expands the sponge making it softer. It stretches the tophsheet but does not change the tackiness. If your Hurricane does not do that at all, if it does not grab the ball at all, it really could be a counterfeit. In which case, it might just be a cheap rubber that is made to look like Hurricane."
639,5f687a04887afbc97df83903,Soft vs Hard Rubbers,make sure topsheet is clean first as well
640,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"I think with harder rubbers all you have to do is swing with a quicker action, and the ball will come out quick and spinny."
641,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"Hi mate,Perhaps I'm not reading your post right, but Vega Europe is what I play with and it's one of the softest I've come across, mine is really really soft compared to a dawei inspirit or even mark 5. I've got a Palio Thors and that's feels like concrete compared to the europe. What sort of rubber do you get well with that's softer?Shaun"
642,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"Ah, what xiom europe do you have vega or omega or another? I'm similar to you I find if I use a harder rubber like thors that I have to really hit forward in a longer arm stroke, what people call chinese, so I'm presuming your stroke is just grooved in a way that works better with softer rubbers maybe. If you want to switch you'll have to regroove it a bit maybe with those rubbers."
643,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"I used to play with coppa silver or nimbus sound, so thats really soft. Now I'm trying to play with the omega europe IV or something. And yes if you compare it with a chinese rubber its still ""soft"", but if you are used to rubbers like nimbus sound, coppa silver it is a really hard rubber. The main reason I want to play with harder rubbers is because most players in my club told me that I can play harder and with more spin, another reason I would like to play with the omega europe is because of the black sponge. It just looks cool.Another reason I want to change is donic,stiga or joola keep on making new rubbers and they stop making the old ones, like they did with the coppa silver. So I think its better to change to Xiom or Tibhar, but none of the rubbers really suits my playing style it seems.If you or anyone else can help me with finding a decent rubber, you would be my hero Tomorrow I will try again with the omega europe with 3-4 layers of boost so if the combination of a carbon blade with omega europe with 4 layers of boost is not fast enough or I cant do 1 decent topspin with it then I have to try something else."
644,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"ur question is why can't you play with harder rubbers? perhaps you've built a preference for softer rubbers. I find that having used soft rubber for the last 5 years such as torpedo soft, rapid dtecs soft, tibhar nimbus soft and sound and other similar rubbers, that I don't like playing with hard rubber I find it lacks the feeling that I can achieve with soft rubber and without feeling in my shots I tend to play muccch worse "
645,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"The contact on the ball is so different from Soft rubbers to hard. I have played with The softest like Nimbus Sound, Nimbus Soft being the one i played with longest. I have played equally as long with T05/64. and I even played quite a while with chinese rubbers tuned and untuned. I adapted to all without taking too much time. But i can honestly say in my opinion and experience that Softer rubbers offer the least to your game. They produce the least spin by quite a fair bit and really dont offer u much more control. They do however provide u with fantastic feeling especially if u liked soft rubbers before.As for short game, the harder the rubber the better the short game yes. You can get more spin and the same if not more speed from your shots but they just simply require a different contact point. All in all with practice the harder rubbers will offer u more. But at the end of the day it is what ur most comfortable with.On a side note the omega europe has black sponge? What about the red sheet? what colour sponge does the red sheet have?"
646,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"@PingPongPom I think I did create my strokes for softer rubbers, but because lots of people telling me that I might play better with harder rubbers I thought I would give it a go. But everyone is returning my attacks so easy now, that I'm getting kind of frustrated Tonight I'm going to train again with the omega europe but with a few layers of boost, maybe it makes the rubber a little softer and faster.@Ndragon I also feel that I can put more spin on any of my shots with harder rubbers, but I like to make points sometimes  and if everyone is returning my attacks like I'm beginner then I must be doing something wrong with the harder rubbers or harder rubbers are just not for me. But I can't imagine that hard rubbers are not for me since almost the whole world plays with hard rubbers like tenergy. So I guess I have to stick to the soft rubbers, but I dont really want to do that because I can only play a month with one pair of soft rubbers, and thats pricey.And yes both sheets have black sponge. It looks really cool "
647,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,Just keep at it. Your problems are similar to mine with soft rubbers. They dont last as long. Although I have another problem with soft rubber which is the FAKE spin. Its easier for opponents to return shots from soft rubbers.You just need to keep at it and eventually u will learn the strokes and contact points in no time making your entire game better. The omega europe. How hard it is compared to tenergy?
648,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"For me the omega europe feels harder but it probably isnt. It just has a different feeling than tenergy if you know what I mean. For me tenergy was easier to play with but I cant really compare the two rubbers because the tenergy rubber was about 3 months old and the europe is new, so its a diffent feeling. I like it when rubbers are a little older (2-3 weeks is perfect to me), they are alot easier to handle then for me. Season for us is almost over so after that I will give the europe a decent try and see how it plays. But why a softer rubber on an off- blade is faster for me than a harder rubber on a carbon blade is still beyond me."
649,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"It is supposed that :HardSpeed + Control - Spin - (incl. producability and sensitivity since in harder sponge, the dwell time of the ball becomes less -> the ball sinks less)SoftSpeed - Control + Spin + (incl. producability and sensitivity since in softer sponge, the dwell time of the ball becomes longer -> the ball sinks more)"
650,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"Don't worry so much about it. I've been using hard rubbers for quite a while now..and no doubt they create a lot of speed. You must adjust your timing with the transition from soft to hard rubbers. The ball does not have a hang time with hard rubbers, and so to create spin you must have a greater acceleration upon contact to create the extra spin. Good luck buddyBtw, I use Stiga optimum carbo with Stiga boosts TP and Xiom pro"
651,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"I practiced a few more weeks with the harder rubbers and now im starting to get the hang of it. I even think the rubbers I got now are to soft I think it just needs time. Im playing with the vega elite on the FH and first I thought it was to hard now I think its too soft, so im going to change to a little harder rubber. Maybe i will take the xiom pro or europe on my FH."

654,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,I find that using a more wrist movement while swinging during a loop helps produce slightly more dwell time with a harder sponge thus creating more brush and spin
655,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"I've heard that blocking with hard rubbers is easier than with soft rubbers!True or rubbish?I think it depends if you feel more comfortable with soft rubbers or with hard rubbers, or am I mistaken?"
656,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"@RhydianI think it is true. With soft rubbers you need to move your racket towards the ball in order to get it over the net, with harder rubbers it is most of the time sufficient to just hold it in one position and let the ball hit the racket. This saves time, and if u have time left u can always play a more active block ball."
657,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,soft rubbers are the ones that helps you find your feel/touch
658,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"ok, thanks WiWa "
659,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"True for me..The hard rubber provides less dwell time for the ball, so the ball bounce more quickly and the rubber is less affected by spin..This makes both passive blocking and active blocking easier..However, this is only my opinion "
660,5f687a38887afbc97df83926,Hard vs soft rubbers,"Nevertheless, out there may also be people who block better with soft rubbers than with hard ones.Personally, I block better with hard rubbers ^^ (at the moment: Donic Coppa J.O Platin ^^)"

It is verry spini, you can lift a ball with rubber. It is a bit heavy rubber. On my BH : Sriver Fx 2.1mm - think that don""t need to explain a lot  much softer. When i hitting a big bounced ball i turn the racket to BH, so hiting a smashes with Sriver(softer) not hard rubber. That is the way i do. I must say that i thought that Dawei ruber so cheap is garbage, but must say i was wrong, verry good rubber. I sugest black 2.2mm on forhend.Best regards from Croatia"

I find that when I hit the ball, I can feel the ball as if it was hitting all the way through my blade. I can get spin, but there's no pace in the ball. Also, I hit with a closed bat, most of my shots ended up in the net if I am far from the table. I noticed that I have to loop the ball quite high over the net to make it to the other side."

I like them both, prefer T05, don't like its price. I actually find EL-P to also be worth trying if you like T05 and find MX-P to be too hard."

One thing I noticed with MX-P, after about 3 weeks of play, either the sponge got softer or I got used to it and started feeling how to get the ball to sink into it. I actually think it may be some of both.T05 and MX-P are both good rubbers. Whichever one is on your racket is the one to choose. Then next time you can choose the same or the other. And that will be the one to choose. Sent from GroundZero from my NanoWeaponOfMassDestruction"

MX-S would as well, but it might be lower throw than you prefer and have a little less catapult. T05 is a notch softer (closer to 45 degrees). Paul Drinkhall has good reviews of the Evolution series in the Equipment reviews section."

682,5f686c0cb59794ca78c70929,Butterfly Tenergy 05 or Tibhar Evolution MX-P?,"Both are excellent rubbers, although I slightly prefer Tenergy 05. MX-P is a bit harder and more linear. Basically you largely get out of what you put in which can make it a little more predictable in certain situations than Tenergy 05. Tenergy 05 has more of a catapult feel, especially when you counterloop. Tenergy 05 is great for adding heavy spin and MX-P is perhaps a little better for hitting and driving."

690,5f686c0cb59794ca78c70929,Butterfly Tenergy 05 or Tibhar Evolution MX-P?,"MX-P has a good arc, but it is not as high as Tenergy 05 (virtually nothing is). But MX-P has more linear control. This makes it easier to predict when playing with it vs. Tenergy 05 in the short game and many situations where absolute precision is required. That said, if you play with heavy spin and adapt to Tenergy 05, you might be more consistent with it as the catapult and spin can help with taking certain risks when out of position.You have gotten some pretty good views already. Mr. Lindsay is a pretty high level player and aside from him, all of us have experience with MX-P and Tenergy 05 and our views are all pretty similar. I am sure that what Mr. Lindsay says will be echoed by just about any world class player out there. I leave the final word to UpsideDownCarl, who said when it comes to choosing between both at our level, the one you choose is the one on your bat at the moment. And since Evolution MX-P is cheaper, it is much easier to start there. If you still feel the desire for Tenergy 05 after that, you will be able to use it if you want to."

698,5f686c24b59794ca78c70937,Tenergy 05 or Tenergy 80?,"T05, the pimples on the topsheet are shorter thicker and closer together which gives it a slightly harder feel. T64 the pimples are taller, thinner and spaced further apart which gives it a softer feel. T80: the pimples are shorter than T64 and closer spaced than T64 but taller and further spaced than T05. The sponge and topsheet on all three are the same. The only difference is the pimple configuration. That is what gives these three rubbers different playing characteristics. I personally like T05 better than either of the others for FH and I like T64 and T05FX equally for BH but for some reason just don't feel T80 works for me. T05 has a higher throw angle. T64 has a lower throw angle. T80 is in the middle. T05 supposedly gets the most spin and is slower. I don't feel it exactly that way. On big swings I feel like T05 is faster. On short swings like banana over the table you can let the ball sink in more and get more spin from T64. So I would say that T64 works better for smaller strokes and T05 works better for bigger strokes. But they are really all close enough that they all are outstanding rubbers even if I like T80 less than T05 or T64. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

I feel this combination works better for me since I put more emphasis on power with my forehand and can put more spins based on my strokes.

Its unique spring sponge makes the ball catapult hard off the rubber but the best part of its speed is when you combine it with spin."

708,5f686c29b59794ca78c7093b,TENERGY 05 RUBBER - 2.1/1.9 or 1.5?,"Sponge thickness would affect how easily the ball reaches the wood. Think of this scenario: A blade without a rubber and a blade with a rubber with any thickness. The naked blade would absorb less energy due to the hardness of the wood. The blade with a rubber would absorb more energy, thus resulting in a short bounce. So the thinner the rubber, the fastest the ball would be spit out of the blade.Note that this is valid for Flat hitting only, when driving (using the topsheet) the pimples, surface and the sponge hardness act as a spring trying to catapult the ball out the rubber.In conclusion, rubber thickness will behave differently when flat hitting or when performing spin shots. Basically, thin rubbers helps when blocking and thick rubber helps when looping.This of course represents only my opinion and perspective. Hope I could help."
709,5f686c29b59794ca78c7093b,TENERGY 05 RUBBER - 2.1/1.9 or 1.5?,"My rule of thumb for inverted rubber is, per wing,~ 1.0 mm for blocker,~ 1.5 mm for chopper,~ 2.0 mm for driver,~ 2.5 mm for looper,And average for combi play, e.g., - 2.3 mm for loop and drive. And most non casual player wont sense the difference of less than 0.5 mm of sponge. So,I suggest you test the 1.7 mm first, to make the ten 05 more allrounder in play. "

I keep block or chop with my Tenergy 2.1mm, so does that mean i must change it if i want to chop and block with it?- I list the thickness from ease of use parameter, not effectiveness parameter. - Tenergy 1.7 mm and 1.3 mm may chop and block easier that 2.1 mm, but doesn't means the chop and block more dangerous, so if you can control it, then no need for a change. - If you do can chop with Tenergy Max, then You are in the same level as Joo. I bought Curl P4 at 1.0mm thickness, if you posted this before then i may go with 1.5mm instead if i want to chop more, blocking is not that main factor i want to think about, but i hope that thickness will give good combo between chop and block anyway.- I use different rule of thumb for pips, Blocker 0.0 mm (ox)Chopper 0.8 mmDriver 1.7 mmLooper 2.5 mm (but, who want to loop with pips anyway?)Combi by average, like blocker chopper at 0.4 mm.So yes, I vote P4 1.0 mm perfect for choppingI want to know if that thickness of rubber has to do with sound hitting the ball, because i tried someone racket for very short time say minute, and when i hit the ball with the racket i hear something like ""Thunder"" sound when hitting it, i feel power, so is that the blade or rubber or thickness of rubber?- that happen in my current combi, def alpha + hurricane 3 2.15 mm.

720,5f686c29b59794ca78c7093b,TENERGY 05 RUBBER - 2.1/1.9 or 1.5?,"For flat hitting, the less tickness means more speed. For topspins, the more tickness means more speed. For touch play, short game, the less tickness means the more control, the more tickness means more bounce and less control. For passive play versus incomming spin (blocks for example), the more tickness means more sensitivity to incomming spin. Appart from flat hitting, the more tickness means less control and more speed, more bounce, more sensitivity to incomming spin. Maybe you don't use topspins and this is why your coach says that, I hardly belieave a TT coach doesn't know that ticker sponge means more speed and less control for about anything but flat hitting. Do you use topspin Tareq ? I'm speaking here for regular offensive backsides, not for long pips, short pips, medium pips and special backsides with absorbing sponge.And last but not the least : more tickness means less feeling, less feedback."

722,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,"Yes, your setup is defiantly on the soft side.In Chinese coaching philosophy, harder sponge the better - this will allow the player to learn to control the ball more by forcing dwell time into the sponge - than oppose to a soft sponge that does it all for you. Same token, harder sponge can provide more spin.I also think 1.7mm is too thin for Tensor rubbers - where sponge technology is really important.I think your ""upgrade"" to 1.9mm will be more idea for a balance of control vs spin/speed"
723,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,"Thanks for the advice Tony. I am having the best season I have had in a long time with this setup (having previously used even softer setups) so do not want to pay £100 to take a step backwards. BUT against certain players and certain types of shots I still struggle which is really annoying. There is nothing worse than refusing a smash because the ball is loaded, but at the same time I must be able to loop with my F/H as it wins me so many points!!Does anyone else agree that the non FX would work well with this blade?"
724,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,"Butterfly's website says that T64 FX comes in 1.9 or 2.1. Are you sure you mean that you are using T64 FX in 1.7? If yes, it might be fake. Tenergy with a 1.7 sponge would defeat the purpose of the rubber. It sounds like you should not be using Tenergy on backhand anyway based on what you do with your backhand. If you push, drive and smack but don't usually loop, you should try a different rubber. You could try something like Xiom Vega Europe or Elite. But it also sounds like you might do better with short pips on your backhand which would enable you to smash much more effectively. There is really not much point using Tenergy on your backhand if you don't do what it is intended for and there are other rubbers that are much better for how you do use your backhand."
725,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,I got mine from teessports. They are the main supplier of Butterfly in the UK I think. My main concern is can my blade take the standard Tenergys In 1.9 without having to be Timo Boll to rally and loop with them especially with my badass F/H 
726,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,"Well, regular Tenergy 05 should be fine on that blade and 1.9 in 05 or 05 FX should also be fine. The question would be, what makes you want to change? Is there a reason? Are you unhappy with your current setup? In what ways? If you like your current setup, there is no need to change. But, you may still want to which is fine. If you switched to 05 you would get used to it. For your BH it does sound like you might do well to hit with a pro and have him watch you play a match or two to see if what you are using is good for you or if there may be something else better. Or: what you would need to work on to start developing a backhand loop. A competent pro seeing what you are doing in person who knows what they are talking about is better than online advice. Of course, that is not always possible. So...."
727,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,"Carl, you can get Tenergy in 1.7mm. It is available from Butterfly.I think not many distributors will stock it, as 1.9 and 2.1 is defiantly more popular"
728,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,"I kinda agree with Carl and Tony on this, you current setup might be on the soft side.. One of my players that I coach uses the same blade as you, but with T80 on both sides. T80 works great for forehand everything But the type of game you describe for your backhand, I would recommend short pips or some soft feel rubber that really allows you to do anything from smacking to looping to pushing. Rasant Powersponge or Tenergy 05-FX 2.1 mm would be great. But it all depends on what you prefer. If you can get some short pips with good spin you should try it, if you won't buy to try, you can try borrowing from a friend "
729,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,Thanks for all the replies really appreciated. At the moment I get really good spin on my shots (I'm great against choppers) but even though I understand spin fairly well I really struggle to return heavy spin. I pull out of smashes too because I can see the fizz on the ball and know it will bite hard so I play the safe option to chop down on it. My doubles partner kills me for it  I find with this setup I play my best ping pong far back from the table as any spin has faded enough for me to topspin it back from either flank at will. I would rather come out on top closer to the net and am guessing harder rubbers will be less vulnerable to spin when there is less pace on the ball?
730,5f686c4ab59794ca78c70950,Blade/Tenergy Advice Needed,"Hey guys I went ahead and slapped on a T05 and T80 both 1.9 and you were right it feels much more balanced. Will need to adjust my F/H loop technique slightly but driving the ball is now a lot more consistent, especially on my B/H. Thanks for your help!"
731,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?",The actual question is: which blade do you want? Because both blades work very well with any of the Tenergy rubbers.
732,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?","ok, Seems like they both are similar.Which one will be faster with tenergy 80?"
733,5f686de66da47ec32a42cea0,"Which Blade for Tenergy 80, Timo Boll Spirit or Michael Maze?",The top ply of the TBS is Koto. The top ply of the MMaze blade is Limba. Limba is softer than Koto. The Maze has a softer top ply than the TBS. I am not sure which is faster but they would have different feeling and they are both close to the same speed. Maybe TBS is a little faster. But sometimes that is not 100% consistent when blades are that close. You could have one Maze faster than a particular TBS and not as fast as a different one. The speed is pretty close to the same and so the feel is more important than the speed here. Do you like softer top plies or harder? But more people seem to like the TBS than the MMaze. Not sure why. I like both. I like the Innerforce series more than either. 😃
735,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"That will be a very top heavy blade if you choose T05 or T64 for both the forehand and the backhand. T64 is faster than T05 and pushes shorter than T05 meaning it is less sensitive to service spin. T05 has more control than T64 and if you like to attack the service then I find it better for the backhand. It all depends on your technique. If you use a European style you probably want T05 on both sides, but if you have a more Asian style T05 FH and T64 BH is a popular choice. If you have a Chinese style I'd recommend a Chinese Rubber on the FH like H3 Neo or Skyline 3 Neo. I also like the 729-5 or 729 SST God Favored (blue sponge) as a FH rubber. Then for the BH you could use T05 or T64 depending on how much you enjoy using your BH. If you prefer to get into BH rallies and have a strong loop T64 is better, but if you enjoy your backhand but do not have a strong loop T05 is better suited."
736,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"Pls dont misslead him.T05 and t64 are both looping rubbers. I used to play tbs and t05 on both sides and now i changed my bh rubber to t64.For long movements with a fast arm stroke t05 is a bit faster then 64. If u use a short wrist movement and dont use that much of a swing u will get allot more speed out of 64 since its much more springy.It all depends on your techniqe. I like to play countertopspins not too far from the table with my backhand. So i really could use both rubbers even though 64 is better in mid distance. Since i adjusted my techniqe and i only use short movements and go over the ball i just get allot more out of the ball in a shorter time.Im trying to play my backhandtopspin like allot of female chinese players do it in there backhand rallies, quick stroke over the ball to play a fast dangerous return that leaves ur opponent less time to react (I think some males play like this aswell; zhang jike oh sang eun and so on).If u prefere wide backhands with a larger movement ( Ovtcharov, Boll or Mattenet) u will prefer t05 which is more sensitive but more controllable"
737,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"If the setup is head heavy with Tenergy on both sides it will be more top heavy with H3 or Skyline on one side and Tenergy on the other since those Chinese rubbers weigh more than Tenergy. But there is nothing wrong with head heavy and there are a lot of people out there who use Tenergy on both sides with a Timo Boll Spirit or an ALC or any number of other comparable blades. Dan uses TBS with Tenergy on both sides. Everyone I know who uses a combination like that, and I know a few, really likes it. And I think the H3 NEO or Skyline NEO on the forehand with Tenergy 05 or 64 on the backhand would be a great combination as well. You can look at my set up in my signature.  I am using a blade that weighs the about the same as TBS and I have used Tenergy on both sides (64, 05). I have also used Skyline on my forehand and now am using H3 NEO. All those combinations have been good. In the end it really comes down to personal preference. When you are a good player you adjust to the equipment you have as long as it is good equipment. And over time you find what will be best for your own game and technique."
738,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"Im currently using stiga clipper wood and its about the same weight as a TBS or might be a bit heavier, but i have no problems with the weight. I have been using T05 and T05fx for about 2 years on both sides, i think i'll stick to it."
739,5f686e046da47ec32a42ceb6,Tbs fh: T05 bh:t05/t64?,"@ Carl - I run the dealership at my club and I've weighed tenergy and my sheets of H3 Neo. I've weighed skyline 2 neo, but have not had a chance to order in some skyline 3 which I really want to now that Ma Long has switched to it not to mention Wang Hao having used it for a lot of his career, but anyways back to topic all of the Neo rubbers have been less than Tenergy by about 15 percent. I don't know about the FX rubbers as I haven't weighed them but to Tenergy 05 I haven't used anything that weighs more than it."

741,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,"Tried all of them, Genius sound and genius+ optimum sound are harder than the nimbus soft/sound and Energy xtra rubber. Compared to tenergy, the genius rubbers are a little softer. The express 1/2 rubbers were rubbish for me. They got some weird catapult effect, when you try to loop a heavy backspin ball, they make a high throw and I always played them over the table.Nimbus soft is a little slower for me than the nimbus sound.Lots of people in belgium play with genius sound on the forehand, its a very decent rubber and I think a good replacement for the tenergy rubbers.So if you like harder rubbers and you dont want to pay too much, I would say go for the genius sound.If you like just a little softer I would go for the genius+optimum sound.And if you want to go for a lot softer, take nimbus sound/soft or the energy xtra.But if you like the feeling of tenergy then nimbus will be way too soft for you. Because for me it feels like a glued samba rubber, which used to be the softest rubber I know when speed glueing was still allowed."
742,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,Thanks for the reply. Nimbus Soft is my all time favourite and most fun rubber with the best feeling for me. But the durability was bad for the price of it.Nimbus Sound was softer than Nimbus Soft. I prefer Soft. So the Genius Sound and Genius+ Opt Sound are both harder sponges than Nimbus Soft?
743,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,and also just wondering what the 'sound' is like when hitting the ball. The 'sound' from Nimbus Soft was so nice. Nimbus Sound was nice too but very high pitched.
744,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,"Yes they both have harder sponge than nimbus soft. I tested them both on a primorac off- blade and they didnt make much sound. I play without boost or glue or whatever there is, so maybe if you boost it you might get some clicking sound. Also it feels like the genius rubbers are slower than nimbus sound/soft, but its probably not true. I think the nimbus rubbers have a catapult effect which makes me think they are faster. But the genius rubbers are harder so they must be faster."
745,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,"Genius also produces much more spin than a Nimbus, Nimbus is perfect for blocking, Genius rubbers for a topspin game "
746,5f686f74a1e880dd66b5fded,Genius Sound / Genius+ Optimum Sound,These genius rubbers generate a lot of spin.

Sounds like some love it some hate it lolI basically trusted what they said on revspin and this sounds really promising there. Generally I am a fan of heavier blades and harder rubbers. But this thread doesn't really answer whether you need a booster except for one post that indicates that
749,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?,"I never really saw the point of getting these rubbers unless you want H3 like rubber without boosting. Nittaku versions already weigh like a brick and boosting will make it way too heavy. If you are okay with boosting, just get a provincial H3 or H3 Neo and boost it."
750,5f68728210fb22f7fce1f888,Nittaku Hurricane 3 Pro Turbo Blue Sponge - Booster/Boosted?,As you can see in my profile I already ply with an H3. Also I already pointed out that I. am specifically looking for a heavy rubber.

Secondly we don't rate the rubbers with the same scale in terms of the rubbers speed, spin, control etc. for instance a beginner might rate a rubber 10 for spin just because that person never tried other rubbers. The ones you should trust are the reviewers and experienced players here in the forum. As for your question, it really depends on you some like it boosted some do not. I say try it without booster first then make a decision."

759,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I have mixed feelings about the EL-S... I just don't seem to get when the catapult kicks in... Maybe I hadn't given it enough time.

761,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Isn't the Tango really soft? I pretty much don't know anything about Joola rubbers. How was your experience with the Rhyzer series?

763,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Sounds like you really don't like the catapultiness of 45-degree (or harder) rubbers. In this case - why not keep it simple and put a softer 42-43 degree rubber on both FH/BH? Both your spin production and control will increase for sure.
764,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"GT is a very hard Chinese-hybrid rubber, 54 deg, tacky. GT PS is its softer and bouncier version (50 deg). Both with monstrous spin capabilities. They most likely use one of Rhyzer sponges. Rhyzer are non-tacky, easy to generate a lot of spin, and very fast, faster than GT.I myself don't like very fast stuff on my FH, as my blade is already very fast, but I can say Rhyzers are quite controllable considering the speed they produce."
765,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"I probably cuold have expressed myself more precisely. I like linear rubbers. I basically liked everything about the H3. If it weren't for the extremely low margin for error, I would still play it today... I just don't like if the catapult sets in unexpectedly. The T05 is actually kind of bouncy at any impact speed. The MX-P and especially the EL-S is good in the short game, but both have their catapult setting in at weird speeds at different hit angles. So I should've written that I like linear rubbers. Going to update my Original Post."
766,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"In long term, Fastarc G-1 would be the best choice from the series for both BH and FH."
767,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"There are S1 & C1 in 45 degree hardness but never tried any of those, those might be too big of a jump in hardness since FX-P is 39-41. Baracuda in 2.0 might be perfect, much more durable, not as bouncy and just a bit harder."
768,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,How Baracuda is much more durable is beyond me.
769,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"Fastarc G-1 as forehand and Fastarc C-1 as backhand. C-1 has a somewhat softer top sheet than G-1 as well as a softer sponge.If you want even softer than C-1, maybe Xiom Omega VII Euro or Vega Euro."

I will also follow this thread since Im in the same situation ""finding replacement to H3 neo""."
773,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"OK, so based on your input, I will further look into the Fastarc G-1 and the Xiom Asia variants. The Fastarc G-1 seems to have really good control and short game, as well as being linear. But I don't know about its spin production - especially on slow loops and the serve, my strengths.If anyone has more input, I'd be more than happy to read it. In any way, I will try to get my hands on some on those rubbers to test them.Cheers guys "

I've read that ppl still boost it and I'm not very fond of boosting.My current standpoint is xiom omega v asia/nittaku fastarc g-1.... Will try either one when I have worn out my current H3..
777,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"FAG1 is very spinny on slow loops, and can produce tons when serving."
778,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"I have seen contradicting views on this. Though, I would like to believe you "
779,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,G-1 is a very very good no nonsense rubber. Spinny and quite fast. Durability is also pretty good for a “made in Germany” rubber. Maybe not as exciting as T05 or MX-P (the first 2-3 weeks) but very solid.
780,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,C-1 and G-1 produce nice spinny serves but they are not very fast rubbers. Both are excellent rubbers if one values both spin and control without sacrificing too much speed.
781,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I eventually decided to go with tibhar mx-s. Placed an order today 
782,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"I decided to give the MX-P another chance. I applied a layer of Falco Long Term Booster to regain its lost liveliness (after 1 month of heavy use, though it dipped in performance far earlier). Now its faster and spinnier again; even has moer control for some reason (might be the softening effeect of FLTB). Still have the same problem of it sometimes hitting the net or overshooting the table, but those are errors in my technique. After I applied the booster, I immediately played better the next sessions. Althoug part of it might be psychological in nature, most of it should be the rejuvinated rubber.For now I won't look into any other rubbers - as that doesn't fix technical weaknesses."
783,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"MXS.It generates more spin than MXP, a little bit slower than MXP. It has softer rubber surface and harder sponge."
784,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,R53 hands down.
785,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"Mantra M is great in a different way because it's japanese made. Other than that, thumbs up for G-1."
786,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,did you boost it after like a month's use and do you even use it on backhand?
787,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"I saw you say you will look into vega asia, but you said that you dont want something to bouncy. Vega Asia is very bouncy, almost like mxp 50 hardness. I find vega x much less bouncier and spinnier. These are the 2 rubbers I have tried that you mentioned. Hope it helps."
788,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I am using it on my FH. It's been about a month and half. I have not boosted it and it's still a spin monster.
789,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,Yeah man same here.I am using it on both sides it is just something else.So much speed and spin.
790,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,The sponge is hard to keep the service short. But the topsheet is so soft I can feel every shot I hit. That's the best thing about it.
791,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I feel like it has the ease to loop underspin like tenergy 05 and we can even power loop like hurricane 3.
792,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I agree. Looping backspin is an ease like T05!! Short game and service is way better than T05. In counter loop I feel the ball so much.
793,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,I play around 5 days a week. And I am feeling a lose of grip after around 7 weeks.What are your thoughts on durability?
794,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"I don't play as much as you do. You can probably try boosting it. R53 reacts really well to boosting. How do I know?I still use speed glue exclusively. When I first got my brand new R53. I put a layer of speed glue on it. It curled up visually. If it reacts to a layer of speed glue, it will likely react to booster oil."
795,5f6872f910fb22f7fce1f8b9,European / Japanese Rubber for spin-oriented play,"For FH in the price range I would suggest:Rasanter R47. Its not as fast as MXP or Tenergy, but great in a short game, fairly linear, spinny on short or full strokes, and great control. Works very well short and mid distance.Another option is Gewo Nexxus EL Pro series, 48, 50 or 53. I used 48 on FH and BH, but prefer it on BH. Suggested it to a friend who used MXP, and he loves it.Another one I've used and like is Xiom Vega Pro, but I think above rubbers are better. I don't like Xiom Vega Europe at all, too soft even for BH in my opinion."
796,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,Depends on your level and control. A 1.9mm dignicscan still go fast at middle distance.
797,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"Just curiosity, should you really be using such a rubber if you still worry about control? "
798,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"Anything can be controlled with a bit of getting used to. But whether Dignics will allow him to do anything he can't with the Gewo, that's debatable."
799,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"The reason I worry about control is not because I can't handle Dignics, I've played with it on different blades, its very controllable, but because I like certain feel of a rubber on my BH and on my FH. So maybe ""control"" is not the right word.For example, I do not like T05 1.9 on my BH (prefer 2.1), but I like it on my FH. Today I tried 1.9 Dignics 05 on a different blade, but the blade itself is more stiff and reactive than my Viscaria, and rubber 1.9 felt fairly soft, so I am not sure how it would fit Viscaria. Plus Dignics 05has way more control than T05.Level wise I don't have an issue handling T05 or Dignics05, but i am roughly 1700 US, and I don't think I NEED it for my level. However, I have some gift cards to burn, so I've decided to try it."
800,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"So I got black and red Dignics 05 2.1.Honestly, so far (3 hrs), rubber is a breeze to control.Rubber is pretty fast, but short game is easy. Its fairly direct, but gives a lot of spin. Lifting backspin is effortless.BH it plays simply amazing since I hit it for the 1st time.FH will take me a little time to adjust on loops because I was playing with chines rubber for a while, but it was good as well, just a bit more difficult to powerloop because of a different throw angle.I know sometimes when you play 1st time with new rubber it seems amazing and then you start seeing problems, so maybe will write a short update in a week.By the way, somebody made a comment about Gewo, and while Gewo is still very good, Dignics is much easier to control in my opinion."
801,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,I fully agree each rubber feels different on different blades ...and i have one blade which is not good in feel with dignics but perfectly fits with Cornilleau Target Pro GT-H47 and opposite on second blade where dignics feels perfect and Cornilleau not . .
802,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,Currently I play with Dignics 1.9 on the BH of my Hallmark Balsa Carbon and I am most impressed by it's control
803,5f6872fb10fb22f7fce1f8ba,Dignics 05 1.9 or 2.1?,"I've tried 1.9 and liked it as well. Don't see much difference in control between 1.9 and 2.1 though. I was worried that 2.1 is going to be too much, but its great!"
804,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"I'm not pro or so, but I don't think any ESN rubber 50+ deg will help you in short touch, push, because they have tension, if you want speed you must accelerate the stroke the efficient way, and ensure the short return with Chinese rubber, I own a Viscaria and it's fast and springy because the koto, but using a Chinese rubber as Jupiter II is awesome and fast, but not springy. May be could be the solution to your issue."
805,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,You can just use the Rasanter that you have. If you need less bounciness then maybe change your technique or correct it. Make your touch better.
806,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"I agree. Coming from the same concept, R50 and EL50 shouldn´t be too far apart.And if you are afraid R50 would be too hard, stay away from anything with ""53"" in its name "
807,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,EL Pro 50 has a different topsheet than EL Pro 48.
808,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"You guys who are saying more bounce, he said he wanted less bounce."
809,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"The first thing you need to think about isn't to change equipment but to improve your technique. Moving from a tensor rubber to another tensor isn't gonna help much. If you are so adamant on spending $, either you need to change to Chinese rubber or a slower non-tensor classic rubber."
810,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Is there a noticeable difference between the ""updated"" version as they call it and the original topsheet?"
811,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Still looking for more info on Gewo Nexxus EL Pro 50.I have been using Viscaria with EL Pro 48 on BH and Rasanter R47 on FH for about 3 weeks now. My short game improved drastically, pretty much immediately after switching to Viscaria. I also feel like EL Pro 48 would fit my FH better than R47, however, R47 is working very well right now, but I feel like I can handle slightly more power with EL Pro 48, and it will give me slightly more control.So still wondering if EL Pro 50 would fit my FH better than 48."
812,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Every company has a 50 degree tensor rubber these days. Way too many to choose from and they probably all play somewhat similarly [when comparing touch play]But if you want something less bouncy for touch play then maybe try a 50 degree hybrid rubber like JOOLA Golden Tango PS.
813,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"I have EL Pro 50 2.1 on FH & EL Pro 48 2.1 on BH of a Mizutani ZLC. I have used 3 other max sheets of the 48 before.EL Pro 50 is the best FH ESN rubber I have used till date. It is different from EL Pro48 - different topsheet. Also, it is more powerful, has more spin & most importantly: it's throw is fairly stable as you increase power (unlike the EL Pro 48). Very grippy. Bites well even with ABS balls (unlike MX-P 50). Great for looping against underspin (unlike MX-P 50). Ball stays on the paddle longer than most, if not all rubbers in its class. Medium / high throw in powerloops (unlike R50 which has medium / low throw).Only thing (for my game I find the 48 better for is (deceptive) serves using a head-high toss (48 is the best rubber I have used for this attribute). With the 50, serving spinny requires a higher toss & better technique.I like it more than Tenergy 05 Hard. Hope this helps."
814,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"It does help, thank you very much. Have you tried Gewo Nexxus XT Pro 48 (or maybe the name is just XT48). How would it compare. I really didn't like it, very linear, couldn't loop well with it at all."
815,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"No, I have. Not tried the XT series but have not heard good things about it."
816,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Would you say that 50 is a looping rubber, similar to 48?Also, as far as the serve goes, I think the high toss works better with 50 because the sponge is more engaged on a high toss."
817,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,EL is your R while XT is your V in terms of Gewo/Androand I also think trying EL 50/53 should work for you.I like personally like harder sponge for FH
818,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Thank you, makes sense"
819,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Yes. R(otation) and EL(asticity) for spin oriented game, V(elocity) and XT(?) for a more direct, speed oriented game, with lower arc.For many, an R/V combination might make sense if the forehand is the spin weapon and the backhand mostly used for blocking and countering."
820,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,FlexTech = XTElastic Rubber = EL
821,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,That´s it.
822,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,50 is a power-looping rubber - sort of like H3N. 48 is looping rubber so long as you don't hit too hard. I do high toss with both 50 and 48.
823,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Can you please explain about 48 what do you mean by open rubber as long as you don't hit too hard.
824,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"What I mean by it being a looping rubber so long as you don't hit too hard is this:When you hit too hard, the throw drops so you get a bit less of an arc. Still not too low - more like medium. On soft to medium-hard loops, it is medium-high to high throw"
825,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Oh, I am not the one who has this issue. I experience this whenever I am in loop to loop rallies with soft rubbers, after 2-3 loop ball ends up at net. Very irritating.Sent from Tapatalk"
826,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Hey Slevin,Have you tried Gewo Nexxus El pro 53? Would you think it will be even better or too hard?"
827,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Both nexus 50 and 53 are bouncy. They don't feel hard. They are just firmer and they don't bottom out.
828,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,how do they compare with mxp 50 and joola rhyzer pro 50?
829,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,I didnt play with any other 50 degree euro rubber. But gewo 50 and 53 felt firmer yet still bouncier and more elastic than regular mxp. Mxp topsheet and gewo topsheet are really different. Mxp feels a lot direct and flat.
830,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,What do you mean by saying that mxp topsheet is a lot direct and flat?
831,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Mxp's throw angle is low. It feels harder. It's not that bouncy. Gewo 50 and 53 topsheet felt softer, throw angle is higher. It's easier to spin sliced balls. But gewo 50 and 53 sponges are firmer. Overall gewo 50 and 53 doesn't feels like really hard. The are just firm."
832,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,So mxp 50 feels harder than gewo 53? Thats interesting.
833,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Hello ,I hope im not too late. there is my advice.I have Xiom Omega 7 Tour Rubber on FH , im loving it. It is easy to smash 3rd balls come topspin on the table. I mean , it has very low throw angle, very hard rubber. Beside that, it is not bouncy. you can serve short. if you receive , you can send the ball short near file . This rubber is different than others. somehow, it works like this, when touch soft, ball goes short, when you hit, it is lightning  . And i had a little research on gewo rubbers; As much as i understood , EL type rubbers are Elastic , its like Tenergy Tensor rubbers. Not like Omega 7 tour above  but XT is not bouncy. i think if you insist to use Gewo, you should prefer XT series rubber.Best RegardsEJ Ibrahim"
834,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Have you ever tried a tacky rubber?
835,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Hello again,I am still looking for the ""perfect"" FH rubber. Tried Yinhe Big Dipper, loved it, but its a bit too slow. Now I put Nexxus EL Pro 48 2.1 in hopes that it will be less bouncy, and it is slightly, but very unpredictable.I am seriously leaning towards getting DHS Hurricane 3 Provincial (Blue sponge) as I loved Big Dipper. My other thought is to try Yinhe Apollo 5 before I go Hurricane route. My only concern is that I am not getting any younger, and Chinese rubbers require full stroke. I can still do it, my movement and stroke are fine, but don't want to change in a few years.Again, suggestions are welcome."
836,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,Try Andro Rasanter R53.
837,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"If you're in the US try Gambler Burst Thor's Hammer. Less bouncy and more spinny than Big Dipper, faster than H3N, but no factory boost so performance doesn't really change over time. Mildly tacky and the tack doesn't fade. I use it unboosted and love it."
838,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"How different is it from R50? I have a sheet of R50, but it is supposed to be very hard and heavy, good spin, hard in short game. How is R53?"
839,5f68736af57afe037caed057,GEWO Nexxus EL Pro 50 or 53,"Haven’t used R50.But can compare to mxp50.Feels softer than mxp50,higher arc and more spin."
840,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"I'm always a fan of Yinhe Jupiter II. Commercial version is decent quality, no need for provincial/national nonsense. Also, R37 is really soft and mushy. Maybe R42 might be a better fit for backhand."
841,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"Bryan,Actually all (4) of these rubbers would be for practicing the loop forehand via drills, blocking, robot, etc. So none of these rubbers would be for the backhand stroke at all, just dedicated practice paddles. I had thought to put spinny rubber on both sides so that I can more easily switch back and forth to see which one would be the easiest to brush/spin--and not buy 4 paddles!i'll def take a look at Jupiter II, the price is great."

I have a NIB Sanwei F3 Pro, would that be an acceptable alternative?Takkyu,of the rubbers you listed, is there a particular order/preference for spin capability? I would probably not consider T05 at this point as I did play with that back to back w/some H3 and the H3 was much easier to brush for me...most certainly due to my inexperience."
845,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"My advice is practice with what you will use in a match. There is no merit to ""training rubbers""."

So far I'm only finding it for sale on Tabletennis11.com, but can't seem to load the page w/US prices.have you tried different versions of 729 Battle 2? Do you have a preference?"
848,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"Oh okay, so you are experimenting with multiple types of tacky rubber. Yeah, I also recommend trying a hybrid tacky rubber as one of your four rubbers. I've tried JOOLA Golden Tango PS and liked it. But there are so many others too. Yogi_Bear is probably the expert. (Tibhar K2, Stiga Genesis 2, Donic Bluegrip, Golden Tango, etc...)."
849,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"BryanY,How about Donic Barracuda? It also looks like the Hurricane 3 National (blue sponge) is even better than the regular H3 for spinning purposes. At this point i'm not even focusing on precise placement, just a medium or slightly higher swing speed and trying to get the brush stroke down--verifying by watching ball response when it contacts the table as well as the sound when hitting the ball."
850,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"Well, Barricuda is not a tacky rubber. If you you are interested in a tensor rubber then there are more modern options that are better than Barricuda. Also, my understanding is that the benefit of the H3 blue sponge is that it absorbs more booster than the orange sponge. So, if you aren't boosting then there probably isn't any reason to pay extra for the blue sponge."
851,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,F3 pro is ok but it is stiffer. I suggested f3 classic becauwe it is softer and slower. It will maximize spinny loops.
852,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"personally i've been playing with SpinArt a long time and I'm used to it, its a hard sponge. Can put a lot more spin, but easier to miscontact. Q5 and Dignics are a bit softer, maybe in that order. All 3 are excellent rubbers. Dignics maybe the easier to control."
853,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,I think you need to try to decide which rubber you want to use. Do Not need to brush the ball as much with tacky rubbers because of the grip. So if you want to learn to brush the ball Maybe rubbers without tackiness would be the best option.
854,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"I am curious to know, and not afraid to ask, why the OP thinks an OFF+ blade is great to learn the strokes he is desiring?At the risk of sounding like a grumpy old dude pundit (Der-Echte is not that) I would say middle of the road Offensive control oriented stuff for blade and rubber until foundations are set enough... but of course there are other paths, such as settling on the equipment suitable for desired play, the train and adjust.I just think it would in long run be easier and faster with a progressive approach - starting with control oriented, leveling up, then finalizing equipment/play style."

It's been hard shortening my stroke to a more euro style, and I found that i really enjoy the bigger brush stroke forehand/topspin, so i thought I would get a few setups--EJ style--to help me work on that part of my game."

860,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"Der_Echte,Definitely going the cheap EJ route. Air Touch01 to work on basic drives and blocks, W6/AK47 rubber on both sides for a friend to play with at work and Galaxy W1 has decent rubber but nothing at the H3 level. I don't mind the V5 with Sawei Target National but handle is flared and I've gotten used to straight. F3 is also flared so I was looking at a dhs 301 straight from princett with H3 and something else, so I posted here for some alternatives."
861,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,Sounds totally fine to me. Nothing wrong with budget EJ-ing. Those of us who are at clubs where we can try out lots of different equipment are spoiled. Side question: Is there a cheap Chinese clone blade of the Innerforce ALC / Harimoto blade? (Preferably Yinhe or Sanwei).
862,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,The 970xx ALC looks like it.
863,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,Unfortunately it has a koto outer ply. I was hoping for a limba outer ply with more control (like the Innerforce ALC). Overall this blade looks a lot faster and seems more like the DHS 301.
864,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,"Koto, limba, honestly the difference is less that you would expect."

868,5f68738af57afe037caed068,High spin rubber setup (2) for brush/loop forehand practice,I would totally disagree with that. Some people may not feel the difference as significant. But that does not mean the difference is not significant.

But 729 bloom spin is 15$ shipping included whereas on alliexpress it costs 9.5$ with free shipping. Princett od great for.buying blades though. They are 10-20$ cheaper and they will seal it for free if you ask them.Don't generalize alliexpress, because IT depends on seller. There are a few threads about which seller to pick.

891,5f687391f57afe037caed06d,Lightweight inverted rubber with hard/tight topsheet,I've got a Chinese friend who plays c-pen and I recommended FastArc C-1 as a BH rubber to him and he absolutely loved it. It's 45 degree so it's medium hard which is pretty sweet for the BH. I twiddle (SH with LP) and use it quite a bit and I also find it amazing as a BH rubber.Mantra S is a really good BH rubber as well. Mantra M feels quite similar to T05 so I would stay clear of it if you don't like T05 on your BH.

898,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Why not read some reviews on the two rubbers? Nobody seems to want to compare them. What makes you want to try these? Why do you want to boost them? It seems from your thread about boosting H3 that you don't really know how to boost yet. H3 really benefits from boost. These rubbers may not benefit in the same way from being boosted. How long have you been playing? What blade do you use? What rubbers are you currently using? Can you give an estimate of your level?
899,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,"When i posted that i had never boost before. Here in argentina boosting is not that common. Argentina has 7 categories and i am in the second highest. Been playing forn6 years now, 18 years old male. Previos set up before testing h3 was viscaria with t05 on both sides. I loved the low throw of the boosted h3 and was thinking that these two rubbers would be out of this world woth just a layer. Tried many different rubbers across the years. But argentina is going through a crisis and spending 40-50 usd on a rubber and not liking it would hurt too much.Also there must be someone who tried this. I would really apreciate experiences rather than opinions such as "" a harder would be better to bost"""
900,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,"I don't get it. You loved H3 but want to try something else? That makes no sense. If money is tight, either the T05 you were using or the H3 you just recently bought and boosted should be fine. Either Mantra H or MXP 50 should be excellent too. But this sounds like and EJ issue. And the EJ virus does not go well with being low on funds. "
901,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Yes you are right. But the thing is i never used chinese rubbers before. And maybe the reason why i loved it so much was because it was boosted. I bought the h3 because my forehand t05 was dead and know im close to changin my backhand t05 and i thought that maybe these where cheapper yet great choices and boosting may make wonders once again. Tenergy here cost 80 usd and mantra or thibar i can get for 50USD. and i allready have the falco tempo long.
902,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,I should have said that earlier it is for my backhand
903,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Why are you thinking of using something so hard for your BH?
904,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,Probably you should get something like ELP if it is for your BH. Regular MXP may be a little hard for BH but you could try that as well. MXP 50 would be better for FH than for BH unless you have really giant impact on your BH loops.
905,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,"I have tried both, boosted with baby oil. I find mxp50 boosted superior in every aspect. But i prefer the mxp topsheet over the mantra one in general. I also didnt like baby oil on mantra h. Did not feel right to me.Mxp50 felt good on bh too. However id personally did not risk to play it BH in official matches. Countertopspin, topspin and over the table play feels really good. Opening up could be hard on BH. Depends on your technique of course. On my FH i did not have big issues since the topsheet grips the ball so well."
906,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,I think you can use both But i Do not think you should use booster. Booster is fine if you only want to win now But if you want good developement and win against better players in the future skip the booster. As a coach for kids i think really fast rackets ans especially booster is like learn to use calcuator instead of learning Math. More of way to try to find a shortcut. I would try mantra H. I use rakza X and like it so Maybe that would be an option.
907,5f68739bf57afe037caed072,Mxp-50 boosted or stiga mantra h boosted,So i can boost

932,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"I guess I prefer power over speed. Mainly for the kick of making those shots The weight of the 290 is 97 gram. The average weight of blades is 86. (Looked it up). My former blade Xiom Axela has a weight of 90 (approximate), so a little less heavy.The weight should be sufficient for that kind of strokes.Reading a lot these past days I start to believe that the plastic ball plays a large part in this whole ‘dilemma’. I used to play, in my younger days, and at quite a high level, with Tibhar Spico Spin (FH), combined with a Charly Roesch blade (very fast) and the hard fast stroke was one of my game best asset. But.... besides it was like 30 years ago (46 nowadays) and both are rubber and blade not on the market anymore.I really wonder if even if I had that combination again, this kind of shot, like I have in mind (trick of the mind...) would still be possible with plastic balls.Anyhow, I will defenitely want know what is possible with nowadays materials (rubbers).And not just buy OVA or Mantra H.Verzonden vanaf mijn iPhone met Tapatalk"

They both excell OVAsia in that department.OVTour is softer and feels more stable with flat blocking, but in general is a more difficult rubber and the flat smashes have to be executed with a greater precision. So for an overall flat play I would recommend Xiom O7Asia over OVTour and OVAsia."
942,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"how about spin for those three, especially on brush strokes"
943,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"They all are excellent for active spin play but are different in style and performance.OVAsia is with hard sponge and hard top sheet, it has less catapult, higher top spin arc than OVTour, back spin arc is almost the same as the top spin. Best for brushing with a full swing stroke. Maximum spin is obtained with thinner brush. Better controll in allround game and over the table. Easier.OVTour is softer than OVAsia, it has lower top spin arc and higher back spin arc. It has more catapult and compared to OVAsia the spin is produced more mechanically as the ball penetrates deeper. O7Asia is with the hardest sponge, but with softer top sheet. Excells in spin in both worlds - mechanical with softer strokes and thiner brushed with harder strokes. The catapult is stronger than OVAsia, but weaker than OVTour. Fastest and for me the best spin. With the remark that spin depends not only on the rubber, but on the player style and how its style fits with the rubber properties."
944,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,Thank you. This question was more for the OP's info. I myself use mostly mechanical spin.
945,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,"The OP is interested in flat hitting, so I must add some remarks - OVAsia is more sensitive than the others to the incomming spin and thats why I don't recommend it here. OVTour is less sensitive and is best for passive blocks, but because of the narrow rebounce angle the flat smashing needs better accuracy. O7Asia has the best ballance in performance in the flat play."

949,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,O7Pro is better on flat hitting spin drive. Smamshers will love it because it is better when you sink the ball into the sponge when you smash. It is spinny but not as spinny as 7Asia.

I have not been playing for a couple of weeks so I almost forgot about this discussion. Last Thursday I played with Xiom OVA and as mentioned by others already, the sponge is to hard and probably topsheet as well. To be honest I couldn’t play my normal topspin game to be able to set up any chance for any flat hard hitting at all. I probably got already so much accustomed to it, that I forgot how it’s missing when it is not there. I put back on MX-P my old rubber, but due to all changes recently I didn’t good at all...Funny though, my clubmate who has playd a variety of Xiom rubbers of the Omega range, and also plays with a Stiga 290 Carbon frame, tried my set-up, and though the rubbers are pretty worn out (but ‘fresh’ glue), did play remarkably well with the MX-P. He even considers buying MX-P now. I guess I have to accept that hard flat hitting is not that much a part of my game anymore (only when considerebly high) and have to accept that I have to play those kind of shots in a more controlled manner with some spin.

953,5f6873c0f57afe037caed07f,Tibhar Evolution MXP or Andro rasanter R47 hard flat strokes,The 290 i would describe as a low throw and direct blade. I find it works best with rubbers that's a little higher throw. I quite like fastarc g1 for flat hits and it also loops well. Esn around 47 hardness works well for me. I recently tried vega tour and that works good too for flat hitting. O7A I found too hard and looping suffered for me.

It doesn’t feel that tacky, but it does what is said about it. Has good speed and control and also delivers good, and for me, enough spin.

They said it is near 48° so it might be a lot faster than Mantra S i guess. I was more looking for something like 45° but maybe i will just wait to get a little bit better before changingDo you think it can be useful to use some time 45° (like a year) or going from 43° to 48° can be OK ?"
960,5f6873c8f57afe037caed083,"Choice between Mantra M, Genesis 1S or Genesis 2S ?",I think 5 degree jump is not too muchyou can only know once you tried it out.45 and 43 is maybe too similar for you to really notice a difference

The angle of contact matters, as of course the Y component of the hitting vector (yes folks, this is actually an application of tensor arithmetic), with the X component determining velocity. Sponge hardness influences energy absorption/return during impact. It shouldn’t be that hard to model this dynamic behaviour, fixing all variables except one.

I think i take this from emratthich that advices often hard rubbersWhat i'm expecting to get - Less bouncy, especially maybe for short push- Better block and less spin sensitive (as the ball get less into the sponge ?)- Better spin when in good position - Somewhat more suited for brushing loop ?- Less control due to more speed- Less control due to harder to engage the spongeI know i should just try but it's around 100€ for 2 sheets (FH / BH)  Not sure if i'm good enough to test it now and if the advantage are worth it ?

977,5f6873c8f57afe037caed083,"Choice between Mantra M, Genesis 1S or Genesis 2S ?",Tip of the day: Mantra is on a never ending discount in Sweden (due to Stiga wanting people to use their rubbers on their home market). You can get it for approx 400SEK which is something like 37€ from ttex.se or sydsport.com. Shipping is probably 10€ or similar.

You need to decide if you want a sticky rubber with more initial bounce but less top speed than Hurricane, or a bouncy and fast nonsticky one. Technique and playstyle will be different. If you want a fast nonsticky rubber with more control than Mantra I recommend trying Fastarc G1, that’s what I’m using now after trying Mantra, Hurricane and (on clubmate’s racket) Genesis. What I particularly like about the Fastarc is that it’s quite nonbouncy at lower speeds, but you get serious spin and speed when you hit harder. Fastarc too can be found at discount prices if you look around some."

984,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"Sounds like you know what you’re doing. A 5-ply all-wood blade is fine. Stiga’s Allround Classic is a widely used one. Rakza 7-Soft has good speed and spin. It’s soft, which makes it a bit easier to do some things and a bit harder to do other things. A tradeoff thing."

989,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"OP, a billion options to go with that would be appropriate for a developing attacking player.Usually the middle ground is a controllable All+ to OFF- blade and control oriented modern dynamic or old school control.The blade you selected with Rakza 7 soft that you also selected will make it easy to learn your foundational offensive and passing shots.No need to further analyze or agonize.Of course, you could go that path and over-analyze everything under the sun and develop ulcers over it... and string it out over a long thread or 12."

992,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),That makes it easy to attack backspin with little effort.
993,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),Loopy reasoning?
994,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"What was on your premade racket? You will definely have a easier time to lift backspin with softer rubbers. But i think you technique for lifting backspin will in the long run become better with a little harder rubber. In my opinion many players fool themselves a bit that they do a great stroke but they are actually getting alot of help from the soft sponge, but maybe that is okay. I still think for the developement that a bit harder rubber is better."
995,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"No effort... but a lot of technique meaning high level. This is not a rubber for a beginner or intermediate player which OP is. Rhyzer 43 maybe, but certainly not 48 for him."
996,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),I also think a bit harder is good for some players and softer for others. 40-43 deg range depending.
997,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"I’m using JOOLA Rhyzer 43 on backhand. It’s great for looping backspin balls. Nice combination of spin and speed and ease of use when looping. (I used to use Rakza 7 soft on backhand, but Rhyzer 43 has better performance. Maybe get the 2.0 sponge so it’s not too fast for you. )"
998,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"The equipment will not do the job for you, technique will."
999,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"True. I can lift mostly any underspin ball with mostly any rubber. Then again, some rubbers demand more and forgive less. To somebody still developing technique/training their sensory system to get going I would advise a soft to mid-hard grippy rubber. Rozena, Vega Intro/Euro, Neoflexx FT 40 or 45, Rakza 7 Soft, Gold Arc 5/42.5, Sriver FX, Mark V — that general can’t-go-wrong (yet already wide) ballpark."
1000,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"RidTheKid is right. Looping backspin is more about technique than equipment. I'm focusing on being more aggressive in this area as well. I used short pips on a hard blade (no dwell). If I can do it, so can you! Biggest tip that I got on this is working on muscle group synergy and maximizing racket speed while keeping a ""relatively"" short swing. It's nearly impossible to be very aggressive on low backspin balls, so work on fast recovery for a stronger follow-up attack.Since you are moving from premades, I suggest you opt for the Rakza 7 rather than the Rakza 7 Soft. Much more linear and predictable (more control), and faster (on the high impact end). If you go Xiom, I recommend the Vega Pro rather than the Europe. Its all preference in the end, but I agree with Lula, harder rubbers are IMO better."
1001,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"As long as the rubber has grip, the rest is up to the user "

1003,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"IMO there is no one-factor corret answer.First it depends not only the players level, but his personal style and the way he implements spin.Generally players who implement more mechanical spin, would prefer softer rubbers, and those who brush - harder rubbers.But thats only general.It depends on other factors like sponge to topsheet hardness and thickness ratio and it depends on the strength of the catapult effect. I don't like stronger catapult for lifting backspin.Speaking of Xiom tensors - Vega Asia DF has less catapult than Vega Pro and has a slightly softer and slightly grippier surface. For these reasons I find it better for lifting. In the Omega line I find Omega 7 Asia to be the best for lifting and attacking backspins. For me it has the best ratio of the above mentioned factors."
1004,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"I enter the discussion. I'm in the same situation, i'm developping my bh topspin and bh serve receiving. I'm playing with baracuda max now, but I'm looking for something new for the next season. I'm divided between El-S and R37/R42. I like grippy rubbers (also for my bh serve), wich one do i chose?"
1005,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"I would choose R42 over EL-S anytime, grippier. And any Tenergy FX over R42, lasts longer."
1006,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),If you are using baracuda i would suggest using MXS instead.
1007,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"About MXS i learnt to fh loop with that. (I started with a chinese battle2). My coach said those rubbers are too hard to delop my looping technique, so i changed into elp on fh and baracuda on bh. Elp is good for me (thinking to change with r42, for more grip) but id like to try something else on bh. I played vs a good player (now is old, but in the past he played in the 2nd Italian league) and he said that the bh is my best shot, so i want to make it very consistent in the first topspin (normally vs backspin balls). Any suggestions??"
1008,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),Why not use the same rubber on both wings so you can develop both more consistently?
1009,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),So r42 for both sides? Or which?
1010,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),"Which ever one feels best to you. If you prefer EL-P or Baracuda, stick with one and slap the same on the other side. If you want something grippier, R42 will be good. Then work on your technique."
1011,5f6873d4f57afe037caed088,Good rubber for lifting/attacking backspin (BH),another option is andro hexer grip.It is spinny and gripy as the name promises and is 45° hardness but the feel is much softer

1022,5f68741cf57afe037caed0a6,Tenergy 05 or Neo hurricane 3?,"I havent known what your playing style yet. If your forehand stroke tends to be ""thick"" (directly and pretty straightly in the ball), you are more European style, so you should stick with tension rubbers like donic jo gold/platin x1, andro plasma or BTF bryce speed, BTF ternegy.However, if you tends to hit the ball ""thin"" (more friction, less power, hit the ball on edge), you should consider chinese rubbers because those generates speed basing on spin. This first sounds ridiculous but try it and feel it. Remember, most importantly, when playing Chinese rubbers, the technique must be altered. You should throw your entire forehand body (including arm, waist and shoulder). It's somehow too complex to describe by words, just research Malong's forehand technique and you'll discover a whole new world of table tennis. Moreover, you must be sure that you can play ""genuine"" chinese rubbers, stay away from ""market"" ones. To conclude, if you are playing tension rubbers effectively, just stay! Otherwise, you're not satisfied or want to discover something new, try ""real"" Chinese rubbers, especially H3 Neo"

1026,5f68741cf57afe037caed0a6,Tenergy 05 or Neo hurricane 3?,"This is all very true. In addition, you have not told us what your level is or how long you have been playing. If you have learned so far on any non-Chinese rubbers, and have played for a long time, you should know that playing with a Hurricane rubber will require fairly substantial modification of your technique as Kruno notes. It is actually a quite big change, and it's not going to happen immediately and not without some frustration and a lot of work on your part. If you are not willing to make a big commitment to this, as Kruno says, you should stay put. With respect to one of your questions, you can use a TBS blade with either type of rubber. (It is one of the great blades ever made). However Tenergy and Hurricane are so different that the blade almost doesn't matter, it will play completely differently depending on which one you choose."

1041,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"If you think tenergy is durable as compared to MX-P, you are on the wrong path my friendSent from my ONEPLUS A6010 using Tapatalk"
1042,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Erm..... I'm not sure what you are basing that on?In terms of durability as far as performance goes..... Tenergy wipes the floor with nearly all rubbers.MX-P is great to start off with, but the factory boost disappears quickly (a few weeks), and the rubbers drops off massively.Tenergy has a gradual decline, which means that you don't really need to adjust your technique to compensate for the rubber.If you do..... It's time for new rubbers.As for physical durability, again..... If you are finding that the rubber is physically breaking...... you've had it for too long!"
1043,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"If feel and hardness, i say mxs"
1044,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"MX-S feels much harder than T05 Hard IMO (well, maybe not much, but it feels harder).They are all great rubbers though - No complaints at all."
1045,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Hi,This good question should be answered by our experts with direct comparative references to the typical attributes among the three rubbers: speed, spin, throw, and responsiveness through the shot categories.Thanks."
1046,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Wow lol - Who do you class as the experts?All of those attributes can only be assigned through scientific tests.One person might think X is faster than Y, and the other person think differently.That type of comparison is virtually impossible to achieve due to the differences in how people play/feel the ball."
1047,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"All three rubbers are unique and different.As different a rubber MX-P is, if you are a T05 user, usually, you can adapt to MX-P using the same strokes with not so much difficulty adjusting, yet the shot result will obviously be a different on than T05.T05 Hard is another animal from T05, the adjustment may be easy or hard depending on your kind of impact.T05, if you use it for hours and hours a day every day, will begin to wane at the 50-60 hour mark and be a shell of itself at 80 hours, near unplayable at 100 hours. That sounds real bad, but many rubbers are not designed to still be performing after 80-100 hours.You can take off T05 and do a light tune job to give it a few more weeks, like say 40 hours more... maybe you can do that twice, but that is pushing it.MX-P will have its built in tuner begin to wane after 20 hours... prolly totally gone by 40 hours of play. Big deal, at least for me it isn't a big deal. MX-P without tuner is perfectly playable all the way to the 200-300 hour mark. After that, it is time to rip that sucka off ur bat and toss it.I see where Donn is coming from, I believe (just like TTD Dan in his reviews) that a DYNAMIC TEST using the likely shot impact scenarios yields a lot more meaningful info.Just like NDH (Should I jack up hiz initials again?) touches on, we as players all have our way to impact the ball and one rubber that is great for a player may be garbage for another.An example of FLAMING Hot Garbage as a player is none other than Der_Echte his-self.As much a growd-up dude he iz, at 110 kg, and as much a MACHO MAN Der_Echte wants to be on the FH wing... Der_Echte simply doesn't cut it for Macho man Table Tennis on FH wing with the harder sponged rubbers. (Unless it is counter-looping, then it is game-on) For the majority of shot situations I use FH, Der_Echte is a total SOFIE... so if I would use a Tenergy, it would be T05FX... FREEKING F. DAMN X. Period.That is an example real life where a review of a top rubber like T05 hard would have next to zero applicability to how I play, since what I do on FH is not very well optimized... I would be fighting against the rubber, the umpire, the janitor, and anyone else in a 2 km radius.EVERY ONE should first understand themselves and what they do first, then be able to tryout for self. Unless one know WHO is reviewing and WHAT they do and HOW they do it, there will never be an effective understanding or relevance of the review."
1048,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Well thank you, Sir.It is not uncommon to read ""reviews"" like this on a German forum:Block: Rubber A>Rubber C>Rubber BSpin: RubberC>RubberB>Rubber ACounter: well, you get the storyAll that from guys that you don´t know, have never seen play and don´t know anything about their experience and knowledge.And basically with a fair chance of someone else seeing it the opposite way.Useless."
1049,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,In my experience MX-P is less durable and the performance degradation over time is much more. As NDH said once the factory boost disappears the performance goes down significantly. I have also had issues with the topsheet wearing out on MX-P which you can see here. https://www.tabletennisdaily.com/for...5-Wear-on-MX-P
1050,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"So in terms of throw angle, speed, etc. do you find T05H closer to MX-P than T05?"
1051,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"if you TUNE it, do you use something like Falco Tempo? Or which booster works best on MX-P or perhaps other Tibhar Evolution rubbers that you recommend?"
1052,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"I tune cars and fish, not rubberz. My friends tune, they know which ones they use.When I was a T05 user for a year until the price rose to unforgivable levels, I could get a month outta tenergy before it was screaming to come off my bat.MX-P without tuner is still a damn fine rubber for macho offensive topspin players."
1053,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"With all respect to all above, and especially to NDH, for me T05H is much closer to MX-S than to MX-P. I would even say that MX-P is far away from T05H in all aspects. I feel T05H harder than MX-S. In terms of hardnes and short play ability T05H is more closer to Omega7Asia.I can't speak of MX-P/S duarability, but if it is at least 40hrs with max performance, its not less than Tenergy. Maybe T05H will be a little more durable because of its harder sponge, but I'm not sure about the top sheet, it would depend a lot on the type of impact and brush. But for sure Omega7Asia has the longest lifespan - till now I have more than 80 hrs of play with no sensible degradation.If you look for a step-up in performance T05H is the choice, followed by Omega7Asia If you look for durability and close to T05H performance - Omega7AsiaIf you look for durability and close to MX-P performance - elsewhere"
1054,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Not comparing MX-P to T05 etc. but if you like MX-P when it's brand new (first 1-2 weeks) and not after the booster effect wears off. Then stop using MX-P the durability of the factory booster is horrible. But if you are like me and think MX-P is way to fast with factory booster on. Play with it 1-2 weeks, factory booster is gone. And then the rubber behaves the same for several months for me. Playing 3-4 times a week."
1055,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Just shows to show how personal it all is.For clarity, the only reason I didn't mention MX-S is because the OP only asked about T05H or T05 and MX-P (not MX-S).Personally, I still think MX-S feels just a little harder than T05H (which really isn't that much harder than T05 to be honest).@Zaid - I think T05H has a similar throw angle to MX-P (it's a bit more direct than T05 regular, which has more of an arc).In terms of spin, T05H wins out and speed is similar between them both.For the price (in the UK at least), I don't think MK-P is worth it compared with Tenergy."
1056,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,Thanks a lot for your opinion. I know the price is not comparable but in my experience Tenergy lasts easily twice as long as MX-P without any performance degradation so in the long run Tenergy seems a better buy at least for me.
1057,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,So it should be easy to adjust from MX-P to T05H then?
1058,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Obviously I don't know your skill level, but there isn't much of an adjustment between the two in my opinion.I generally find this whole ""adjusting to rubbers"" to be a bit of a red herring.Sure, if you are playing at a very high level, and have been using the same rubbers for a long time - There will be a slight adjustment when you change rubbers.But for the vast majority of people, the change isn't particularly big, and can be overcome very quickly (a few hours at most).This is assuming that you are sticking with a similar rubber of course (not changing from Tenergy to Hurricane for example).On the ""durability"" side of things - I too find that Tenergy lasts around twice as long as most others I've tried.If you can afford it, it's a no brainer in my opinion.That's not to say there aren't some really great rubbers for a fraction of the cost (because, there are). But I'm happy to spend twice as much on something that gives me 10% (at most) more, whilst lasting twice as long.Everyone is different, and people will like different things - But I don't know many people who have used Tenergy and moved away from it through personal preference.It's usually down to cost (understandably so).I'm sure there will be a few who just don't get on with it - But the vast majority of people I've met would use it if they could."
1059,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Perhaps, due to VAT, things are different in the UK. Out here, in the US, T05 / T05H are $80. MX-P, effectively, can be had for $30.The most economical solution for near-T05 like characteristics is a boosted Donic Baracuda - even cheaper than MX-P. Other MX-P substitutes: Gewo EL Pro 48 (similar throw and dwell as T05).For me, T05H lasts significantly longer than T05 (and hence, is a much better buy). However, I have switched back to H3 Natl for more control - let us see if my shoulder holds."
1060,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,I'll give T05H a try then. Thanks to everyone for the help.
1061,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,Maybe UK has a special price on T05. But otherwise I don't see how there can't be much difference. For example you can buy MX-P from Dandoy in belgium for 33euro per sheet if you buy 4. As England is still in the EU right now there is no added tax etc. Shipping is free as well.If someone has a shop where they buy T05 from in UK for around the same price please let me know as I will order all of them...
1062,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Tenergy is £56 in the UK, EVO rubbers are typically £40.For me, the extra £16 is worth it. Having used MX-S for a few months, I liked it on the forehand, and would have no problem using it. I just prefer the overall feel of Tenergy, and I’m happy to pay the extra."
1063,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,I understand that people prefer T05. But as you can get EVO rubbers for £28 if you just order it on a website with free shipping and 1 week delivery. Then you are paying £28 extra.
1064,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"If it's not worth paying a little extra for your favourite hobby/passion, then what is."
1065,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Yeah, I get that, and for people who are money conscious, EVO rubbers would be a great option. I’m luckily not needing to count the pennies right now, and can afford to pay that little bit extra for Tenergy. Plus, given the fact it lasts longer (in my opinion), you are probably only saving £10 over a whole year, as you’ll have to replace EVO rubbers more often."
1066,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"I agree. It's about priorities. I value quality, and it costs more obviously."
1067,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Ok, I get your point.But as others said, its not £10, but £28, and £56 for a pair. So if you change rubbers once per year its £56, and having in mind the galloping prices in GB its really not a big deal. And yes - to everyone using only 1 set of rubbers annually I would higly recomend Tenergy. For 100 hours of passion annualy its really worth to pay the double price. I see it here the same - almost all of the guys, playing once weekly for an hour and a half, use Tenergy and don't bother about the price at all, as they change rubbers once per year or two.But if you play 300+ hours annually and you change rubbers every 3 months, than the extra cost is going to £224 and begins to matter."
1068,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"I was playing 100+ hours a month in Korea. One month was it for Tenergy rubbers, 3 months was it for Aurus, MX-P has same durability as Aurus.I was using an $8 rubber on BH and after a year in Korea, I realized I could afford one sheet of T05 a month at $50 USD in 2010... since my BH rubber lasted 3 months... so a change of rubbers was $50-58 USD... reasonable... but then price jumped to over $70 USD a sheet and that was it for me.That was my price point analysis breaking point."
1069,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"My calculation - while I change Omega rubbers /pairs/ on every 4 months, 3 times per year, they cost me £183 annually.But with T05 I have to change on every 3 months, 4 times per year, and they will cost me £412 annually.The extra £229 is equal to my annual club tax, or more than to double the Omega pairs, or to please myself with some good portion of EJing."
1070,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Sorry, but you are missing my point about it lasting longer. It’s not as drastic as this, but for arguments sake, say I change my Tenergy rubbers twice per year, but I’d have to change EVO rubbers three times. Tenergy = £112 * 2 = £224EVO = £80 * 3 = £240Now, it’s not quite as bad as that, which is why I said it would be roughly £10 more per year.But due to the fact I can play with Tenergy for longer, the extra cost is decreased when compared with other rubbers over a whole year."
1071,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Ok, in your case Tenergy proove better.Let the OP take his chance with Tenergy and share here his experience "
1072,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"But now to have real quality rubber you can't even have T05 anymore. As more expensive = more quality, So now it's 100 dollar per sheet as everyone will have to use Dignics 05. "
1073,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Haha - I'm not sure Dignics will be on my blade anytime soon.But..... If Dignics lasted longer, or genuinely felt better for me - I may try it.It's like when you go into a supermarket and look at the prices of things.You'll see the headline price £5.00, and then underneath you'll see the ""price per XXX"" - This is usually in weight, so it would be ""price per grams"" for example.The cheaper stuff is generally more expensive ""per gram"" - So you may think you are spending less, but you'll have to do it more regularly.In these instances, it's better to spend more, and your overall spend will be less (as you'll need to buy less of it).Now, I don't see Dignics being this for the record - I see Dignics as a marketing exercise to see just how far Butterfly can push the boundaries!I also don't see how it can be the much better in terms of quality/speed/spin over Tenergy - The ONLY reason I'd buy it is if it lasted a month longer than Tenergy."
1074,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"NDH how do you find T05H compared to T05 or more Chinese style rubbers? Im thinking of trying a sheet on my FH as my battle II is coming near the end, but I don't know anyone who has it to try it out. So seems like a bit of a gamble but I prefer a harder rubber on my FH."
1075,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"I like it, but I've always been a Euro/Jap rubber user.I've tried Chinese rubbers (to test), but it's not what I use regularly.T05 Hard, really isn't much different from T05.If you don't like T05, I'd hazard a guess you probably won't like T05 Hard.I personally found MX-S to be a little closer to a Chinese rubber, although others may disagree."
1076,5f687425f57afe037caed0ab,Is T05H or T05 closer to MX-P?,"Ahh cool makes sense. Am thinking of experimenting a bit over the summer league, so might not be for now."
1077,5f68742ef57afe037caed0b2,Should/can I re-glue my rubbers?,"You can and you should. Be careful not to damage the blade while removing it, slowly pull from the handle and up. The only tricky part is to place it back dead center. I usually place it 1mm towards the leading edge (left on BH and right on FH) to avoid wood sticking out and splitting balls should they hit the edge there. You shoul glue the rubber the same way you remove it - from bottom and up, ideally pressing it down with a roller. The pressing part helps unshrink the rubber to the point where it covers the entire blade or, often, even sticks out."
1078,5f68742ef57afe037caed0b2,Should/can I re-glue my rubbers?,"If you want regluing your rubbers, they will shrink for sure, so you have to boost a little bit just for expanding and ensure to keep pressing after gluing, and when they sticked strongly you can cut the broken side."

That is a very fast blade right there, if (s)he's indeed using a Mizutani ZLC...But I've played with both T80 and T05 on slower blades. I slightly preferred T80 in serving, the short game, active blocks and counterspins at/above the table. I preferred T05 for looping in general, especially on deep backspin openups and in powerplay away from the table. I can brush loop well with T05, and have a hard time with that with T80.T80 is quite a bit more reactive, and when I play it produces flatter trajectories, with a substantially lower margin of error. T05 offers more safety. If more control is required, I wouldn't move from T05 to T80. Quite the contrary. A blade a notch slower/less edgy, though..."
1083,5f687444f57afe037caed0be,Butterfly Tenergy 80 or Butterfly Tenergy 05?,Keep same rubber and stop applying the booster is the most same thing to do if all you want is a reduction in speed.

1112,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,Long pips is fun. You can start with Ritc 837 which is very cheap.
1113,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,"755 0X is good too, many say better.i have a “fun” paddle. It is a LKT Instinct with LKT Pro XT and 755 0X. I can chop or play push blocker style with it. My “fun” paddle is a compromise but it is easy to use."

1115,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,"I ordered also 2 sheets of 755 OX to build a fun paddle, you can try it! it's very cheap!"
1116,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,The hard part will be gluing the 755 0X to the blade. The 755 0X will curl up into a ball and be unusable unless you first tape or pin down the corners when applying the glue. Wait for the 755 0X to become relatively flat again. Then use a sheet of wax paper to put on the blade and put the 755 0X on top of the blade where you want it. Pull out the wax paper a little at a time so only a small part of the rubber become in contact with the paddle at a time. Make sure the rubber attaches smoothly without bubbles. Then pull out the wax paper another little bit. I think there may be a YouTube video showing how to do this.If you want to have fun with your second sheet then put it in the sun to age it. When it starts to smell it is done. It may take a few days depending on how bright the sun is. I put mine in the back window of my car because where I work the back windows faces south. It is also easier to tell when the pips are done by the smell in the small confines of a car. If you wait too long the 755 0X pips will be frictionless but brittle so they will break too easily. This is a cheap way of getting almost frictionless 0X LPs.
1117,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,Tape/pin the corners of the OX sheet down. But don't have to wait until it flat. Just wait until it and the glue on the blade dry then put the blade on the OX sheet. This reversed process works perfectly.
1118,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,Don't u think that there would be NO fun in practice vs. short pip chopper or frictionless LP pushblocker?..
1119,5f687445f57afe037caed0bf,Fun/ Practice Pips,"I did try short pip chopping but it was hard. However, LP chop block combined with chopping is fun and this is my style now."

1122,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm,"""Enough"" speed is a very personal thing. Genesis II is pretty different to Mantra - it's slower and semi tacky. The tackiness might make more of an impact on your game than the basic speed, so best to take that into consideration as well."
1123,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm,I would rate Genesis II as tacky. Very different to the original Genesis. Not as extreme as H3 Neo or Battle II but still tacky. It's for sure slower than than Mantra M. I've played with both Genesis II M and Mantra S on the backhand and even Mantra S is a whole lot faster. It's also worth to mention that Genesis is quite spin sensitive so the receive game will be impacted.
1124,5f68746cf57afe037caed0d2,Stiga Mantra - Genesis difference / Donic Blestorm,I got it. Thanks. Thats what i wanned to learn. I’m focuse on backhand winners usually. So genesis ii not so effective rubber for me.

1126,5f687481f57afe037caed0df,Durability: Tibhar Evolution/Donic Bluestorm/Andro Rasanter,The newer bluestorm and rasanter series seem to be more durable than mxp although playwise mxp still seem to be better.

1134,5f687483f57afe037caed0e1,Has anyone boosted Stiga Mantra H/M?,Well it was easier to block because the H version softened.

1145,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,So tenergy would not be a good option right ?
1146,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"It would be an expensive option, offering more catapult than your H3 but way less than MX-P - yet you would find similar characteristics in Vega Pro or maybe Stiga Mantra M/H, for a fraction of the cost."
1147,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"Given what you don't like about ELP, MXP would be worse. I suggest ELS."
1148,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,"Like others have said, MX-P would be the worst of the lot.However, I think you may find MX-S quite good.It feels closer to H3N (it is still quicker), but doesn't have as much catapult as some of the softer sponged EVO rubbers (you'll probably prefer it to EL-P).It's hard to say really - MX-S would be a good option - But there is a chance that all the EVO rubbers will end up being too fast."

1150,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,Heard that xiom rubbers have very short life span and need to be replaced consequently.

1153,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,The Xiom rubbers that I've used have held up pretty well. (Vega Europe DF and Omega V Asia). Much better than Tibhar Evolution rubbers which always seem to flake off on the edges. If you want the least amount of catapult from a tensor then maybe try Xiom Vega Intro. It's less expensive too. As far as sponge hardness goes... That depends on whether you impact the ball hard enough to compress the sponge. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
1154,5f687490f57afe037caed0e9,Mx-p or Mx-s for FH on a zjk alc?,The omega vii series are pretty durable imo.

1156,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,I've heard that the Acuda S2 is a good alternative. But I haven't tried the rubber myself. Perhaps someone else can elaborate.I have used Big Slam on Forehand and Backhand as well and switched also because of the same reason 
1157,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"Well maybe someone who's played with both would be the best deal for you, so if NL reads this im sure he could answer more precisely. IIRC he played with both. But until then i'll try to helpout. See, i haven't played with the Barracuda nor did i play with Barracuda big slam, but i've had the Acuda S2 on my racket for a session of 2 hours, but tore it off after that session 'cause i found it too bouncy for my likes.Its so called catapult effect just came too surprisingly and not linear. So after that session i went back to my old Bluefire M2 for a week, and then switched to T05.But since you seem to have trouble reading spin i hear very good things about Xiom Vega Pro. Maybe you can find someone who uses it and lets you try it. I've also had a hit with Baal's Karis M which was also very easy to handle.But then again there are NO SHORTCUTS  in TT and it will help your game much more if you would learn reading spin better, so changing rubbers might not be the best solution to fix your problems when receiving spinny serves.Rather try to find a good server and try practicing with him a lot. And i really mean A LOTGood luck."
1158,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"I agree with what you say Suga. The only problem is that I found the Baracuda topsheet to be extremely spin-sensitive. I think the only comparable rubber would be T05 in terms of spin-sensitivity. I have played with rubbers that are supposed to be sensitive to spin (Vega Pro, Fastarc Series, MX-P, Tenergy 80, Rakza 7) and none of them came close to the Baracuda in this aspect."
1159,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,Tenergy 80 is a very nice rubber. If you want something cheaper your could look into vega pro (harder and heavier) or vega europe (softer and lighter). I transitioned between these rubbers without much adjustment.
1160,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"Rhyzer 43 (outright power & spin) or Aurus Select (consistent, higher throw & good control)."
1161,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"Thanks a lot guys,it sounds like I am going to try Ten 80 then. We'll see how it goes. As far as reading spin, even if I know precisely what kind of ball is coming I STILL find it hard to return serves. I think the Baracuda is just too sensitive for me. But again, on the flip side, I love that popping sound when doing top spin with the Big Slam."
1162,5f6874c4f57afe037caed10b,Donic Baracuda stick or twist?,"For a like for like replacement you would look at Tibhar Genius Sound and Andro Hexer Powersponge, as these along with Barracuda are from the same generation and share many characteristics. See the comparison of the three in the harder sponges here: https://www.tt-spin.de/tibhar-genius-vs-donic-baracuda-vs-andro-hexer/(use google translate on Chrome browser). I found T80 underwhelming and not very 'clicky', it's good but not worth the money as there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, Rozena is closer in hardness to Barracuda Bigslam. Genius Sound or Optimum Sound gets my final vote for a direct replacement."
1163,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"Battle II is the best tacky chinese style rubber currently available. It's kinda like H3 but a lot faster and great for drives too, while being tackier also."

1194,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Good point. The rubber was sealed in plastic so I guess that it must be some kind of reaction to the VOC used in the manufacturing process. It's a fairly cheap rubber so I think that it's safe to assume that their QA process isn't 100%.
1195,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Some feedback. I'm extremely happy with B2 after an initial 1.5h of training. Flicking heavy backspin serves is extremely easy. The short game is excellent. My backhand loop is very poor due to bad technique but the rubber was way easier than H3. Not as linear as H3 (which I think is a good thing).I'm amazed with how tacky it is. The ball is pretty much fixed to the rubber even if I tilt the rubber to 45 degrees.
1196,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"Yup.Ppl don't generally believe how much of an upgrade it is over the H3Neo which it resembles in style until they use it.It's faster period, while also having a sweet, very gentle catapult, while still being more controllable in the short game than any tensor, about twice as tacky as h3 no joke, great for drives, consistent in make, lasts forever.For anyone who likes tacky rubbers, I think they hit the sweet spot with this one, where everything just comes together perfectly."

1200,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"I wanna share some about B2,I really love tacky rubber, but cause my inconsitensy technique and power im searching a tacky rubber with a more springy sponge like nittaku h3, spinart, mantra etc.. But i keep searching cause i felt it quickly not so tacky anymore.I know B2 regular not with a spring sponge but cause its cheap enough so i try it.. wow it suiteed my game very much, its just like a spring sponge on it , still good when close play & the tacky spinny top sheet last long enough.. My drive, my loop, my spin, my power, felt improved.., Well overall B2 regular its just like H3 that i like but more suited / easier to use for me.From that moment i stick with B2, i tried B2 provincial (40 deg) but i felt not as good (the rotation) or easier to use like the regular one (maybe coz the sponge degree).. But still better compairing when i use h3 prov (40 deg), soon i'll try B2 blue sponge prov (39 deg) hope it feels like im expected.Well i really not sure i have to be happy/not when people say how good about this rubber, im affraid when more people realise this rubber is really good.. 729 will increase the price ..

1201,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Thanks for your review.I have been thinking of B2. Just not sure if I should try the normal one or provincial one. I have been thinking of Yinhe Big dipper after reading some good reviews. Has anyone played with both B2 and Big dipper? Passionate about TT
1202,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,Big dipper is a lot closer to european rubbers while B2 is a lot closer to traditional chinese rubbers.
1203,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"http://www.prott.vip/Product-Details...vincialBattle2 this is where i got it from ask the seller to get some in for you . amazing seller Well its kinda like Hurricane keep getting better with the versionsThere a simular rubber just things get easier to do things for me battle 2 is like a cross between Neo H2 and Neo h3 with resistance to spin with blue being the best .The commercial has a crap topsheet so less then 6 months it will ware but i put alot of oil , but still works okay also the best thing about it can take a beating with oil but it lacks hitting threw it and lacks spin.Things get alot better with Battle 2 provinal imo its a better neo h3 prov and the top sheet lasts and everything increases some how ,just like hurricane does just the only negitive a little dead feeling depending on the person and a tad lack of spin. The Blue is just the best the only negative is you loose a little control dueing to it being like 39.5 degree but gain everything 10-20 % more spin its alot more alive , unless 729 release a national version im going to stick with the Blue for me the only other rubber like this national Neo h3 BS just a cheap version and it does the job.the Battle 2 prov orange version is better in 39 degree then 40 you are very right dons7er just loose a tad bit of power that the 40 has. oil has so many different feeling , iv used Haifu seamoon , Haifu black oil , Dan chi , Lidu oil yellow imo lidu is best for its price but i havn't Haifu yellow oil coz of better feeling in lidu and dont loose anything. and i hope that kinda made sense"
1204,5f6874d4f57afe037caed116,Friendship/729 rubbers for post-speedglue era,"Compared to Battle 2 (only tried commercial 47 deg), BD is:- less tacky (but still enough for a solid short play);- significantly higher throw, comparable to that of H3 (my sheet of B2 has medium-low throw).Regarding hardness, 47 deg B2 is similar to 38 deg BD when fresh, but BD tends to lose factory boosting quite fast (approx. 2 months), getting harder. Also, ALL Yinhe sponges I've tried do not hold the booster well, and BD's is not an exception. Don't know about B2, but, considering it plays like new after living in a drawer for more than a year..."

1234,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,number 1 is price-chinese rubbers are much much much cheaper than euro/jap rubbers2.i like spin and speed that chinese rubber provides i played for a long time with euro rubbers but that rubbersjust dont fit to me

1238,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Haifu Blue Whale II and Tibhar Grip-S are good choices for the FH. I think for the super inexpensive, solidly decent rubber for the BH, Der_Echte's Dawei 2008 XP Power Sponge is as good as you can get for the price.By the way, I think there is a reason why so many of the top Chinese players use H3 or Skyline, but I did not list either in my choices because you asked for rubbers other than them. I used Dawei Saviga a long time ago and that was pretty good. I don't think they make that anymore. But Dawei Inspirit is pretty good as well."

1241,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,have tested Skyline. good spin but I have difficult with the chinese sponges. i get no speed. good in teh spingame.
1242,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"With Tacky rubbers that have hard sponges like Skyline, where you get the speed is by having good bat speed and brushing the ball. The sponge does not give you the real speed, the topsheet does. When you do it with a certain technique, the ball goes. Not good for smashing but excellent for brush-looping."
1243,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,my technique on the forehand is not that strong. then i follow why not i get the speed i thought that i should get. any rubber you can advice that help me with the speed?
1244,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"I am looking at your profile says your blade is. You have listed:Butterfly Timo Boll Innerforce ZL. Since there is no such blade but there is a Timo Boll ZLF and an Innerforce ZLF, I am going to ask you, which blade do you have. I don't really need the answer though. That blade is too fast for you. If you can comfortably say that you realize your forehand technique is not that great, then you should probably be using a slower blade to help you improve your technique. Why? You are using fast equipment hoping it will make your balls faster without having the technique for the blade. If you use a slightly slower blade it will help your technique improve, it will improve your stroke and then you will start getting more power. Put the ZLF blade, which ever one it is, on the shelf for a year or so, and get a blade that is better for your developing your technique. Here are four great options:Yinhe Galaxy 896 blade (only $16.00 USD but it is a pretty good blade)Stiga Allround Evolution (approximately $40.00)Stiga Tube Allround (approximately $45.00)Butterfly Primorac Off- (approximately $70.00)Which one is about personal choice. The interesting thing with this, the most expensive one is definitely not the one I think is the best even though they all are great blades for any player who is below 2200 USATT rating level. In other words, until you are REALLY pretty darn good, these are excellent blades for most players games. What rubbers should you use. What your profile says you are using should be fine. You just need to work on good strokes, proper contact of the ball, in short, technique, technique, technique."
1245,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Thanks for detailed reply. In blades I have a Timo Boll Alc blade. just wanted to see if someone should notice my blade i had listed and you did .I will follow your recommeded choices of blades, think i will test Stiga allround evolution. $40 sounds price worthy. thanks for great advice."
1246,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"That is really a great blade. I used that for over a year and the only reason I changed to my current blade is that it was given to me by a pro who is sponsored by Butterfly who just had it and knew he was not going to use it. Otherwise I would still be using it. If you are using a TB ALC, you will have to get used to the thicker handle from Stiga. Perhaps get a Master Flare rather than a Legend Flare. The Master is the slightly smaller flare. It will still be much thicker than the butterfly handle. After a few days you will be used to it. I personally like both thin handles like Butterfly and thicker handles like Stiga. Also, the rubbers you are using are good. You don't need to change them if you like them. But if you wanted rubbers that are pretty good that cost $10-$15 less that are pretty comparable and have really good control, speed and spin, Xiom Vega Pro for FH and Xiom Vega Europe for BH is a pretty good combination. Aside from that, technique, technique, technique and you will get your forehand top notch. By the way, if you are interested in reading what someone else writes about trying that blade, have a look at this thread:http://www.tabletennisdaily.co.uk/fo...al-quot-Review"

1282,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"My fav Chinese rubber was probably Geospin Tacky or Gambler Wrath. Both of these were similar in that they were on pretty soft sponges for Chinese rubbers. I don't like hard, stiff sponges. I prefer the feel of something springier.In my experience while both these rubbers come crazy tacky when new, we're tallking being able to pick the ball off the table and hold it upside down for a minute or so, they, just like every other Chinese rubber I've ever had, can no longer come close to repeating that feat within a few days of playing. I clean my rubbers & use protectors after every use. Still same story. So in the end I always felt like I ended up with topsheets that are very grippy but no longer tacky. Basically like euro topsheets but not as good of sponges. That's why I made the switch to some higher dollar rubbers.Whew that was long winded. Anyways, Geospin Tacky & Gambler Wrath play pretty nice even after the tackyness wears off as they're on nice soft to medium sponges. Can generate a good amount of spin IMO."

As all chinese rubbers they collect dust more easily. Non boosted its slower but alot och control and very high spin. Higher throw angle. Boosted it really shines!"

1288,5f68775864fe8d59b1ff54c7,Your favorite chinese/chinese like rubber,"Hi Tom. Which DHS rubbers are closest to the Genesis M ? I'm eager to try Genesis M rubber on my BH side. But based on my personal experience using DHS rubbers on BH, I don't really like the tackiness from DHS rubbers especially Hurricane series when used it on BH. Do you think Genesis has the same feeling as the DHS rubbers on BH ? I've already seen your video review of Genesis M rubbers with Dan many times, but I'm still unsure to try that rubber out because I'm worried that Genesis M will give me the same tackiness feels of DHS Hurricane."

1300,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"I tried them out myself the other day(a mutual friend happens to be have connections with the company) and it was just superb. Loved it. I tried it on my DHS MaLong5 blade and it did wonders. Prior to the two(both Sunnysix7 & Sunnysix3), I used DHS Hurricane3(Provincial=ShengGuang) for my forehands and Tenergy64 on the back.I would say the Sunnysix7 is a great substitute for Chinese rubber fanatics. Fantastic spin and marvelous counter-attack. It gave my club opponents a super hard time  What really surprised me was the Sunnysix3. I'm generally really agressive on both sides but I always wished that I had more stability on my blocks and counter-attacks(like FZD). The Sunnysix3 is just that. Super secure. It gives you that great balance between Boll's machine-like stability. I've always thought Tenergy64 was the real dealbut I kinda missed the depth and spin. Tenergy always had great speed but it never really feels 'powerful' with the block. The Sunnysix3 did just that. With the right channel expansion and marketing, I believe this company will do wonders. As for pricing and retail I have no idea which is why I'll go back to my buddy and ask him for a box before I return home.Hopefully I'd be able to share some snaps and actually weight the rubber as well. (So there, that was my first post ever. Glad that I could give back in some way. FYI I'm super picky when it comes to products. Feel free to comment and ask more about any other stuff.)"
1301,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Really interesting to see a review from abroad. Sounds like what the company claimed is true!Both sunny 7 and 3 are released yesterday in Korea and I hope they would be great alternatives to DHS Hurricane rubbers.Would you share some snaps and weights of the rubbers? Because only the covers are available so far.
1302,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"[QUOTE=overdrive98;192190]I tried them out myself the other day(a mutual friend happens to be have connections with the company)Excellent! Sunsix7 sounds like a great alternative but I'm already very very interested in the Sunsix3 for my backhand. If you could share more details on the specs and pricing it would be awesome as well. We'd really appreciate it! Provided that it also works for my game, I'd be really happy see a pricepoint somewhere around TibMXP or at least still much under the obnoxiously pricyTenergy. BTW a well known coach in my club once told me that his experience with the players using Chi-rubbers well was this: ""Chi-rubber players definitely have nasty spin. The speed is definitely much stronger than that of Tenergy other mainstream German rubbers but it feels like you are hitting a gold ball on a heavy spin. You can block fast/light shots but its harder when you defense or counterattack a so-called 'heavy' ball."" Merci. A+!"
1303,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,one thing I have learnt is to always go with a rubber that is accepted widely.even the ITC rubbers that came out last years were poorly made. Far inferior from the same price Donic/Stiga rubbers.This SunnySix rubber sounds appealing but I doubt it will be as good as what they say it to be.(The terrible package make it more doubtful)

Some people aren't necessarily 'label conscious' as Koreans  for me, I am personally excited to see another 'Chinese style' rubber thats not a Chinese brand. Only one way to check!"
1305,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"I have had the opportunity to test sample sheets of this new rubber which is already out in Germany, but currently 1.9 mm only, 2.1 expected for August.The performance excels many other 47.5 degree rubbers in terms of spin creation, largely due to a relatively soft top sheet on the explosive new (pink) sponge. In direct comparison, this new rubber generates more spin than the HYPE XT 50 pro and is only marginally slower, and it is faster and spinnier than the HYPE EL 47.5, but less bouncy and more linear.I would prefer this rubber to Evolution MX-P and EL-S alike, since it sits somewhere in the middle - the sponge hardness of MX-P, the elastic top sheet of the EL-S - and thus gives me the best of both worlds: Easy opening on underspin and maximum power on winning shots.With GEWO´s well established quality control, I am pretty confident that the finished rubber will perform as good as the factory sample, and that makes the HYPE KR a very attractive recommendation for offensive players looking for maximum spin and speed, yet need control on passive shots and in the short game."

1324,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"since I am based in Korea, I just recently got my hands on the Gewo Hype Kr and will be getting the sunny7 rubber in a couple of days. I tried out the Gewo on my backhand side and I loved how I was able to backhand loop heavy underspin balls very easily using this rubber. It was very bouncy at first so I had to get used to it but I like the responsiveness I got with it. When I get the sunny7 rubber for the forehand side, I will try it out and let you guys know"
1325,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"A quick Gewo Hype Kr review. Having played with a tacky chinese rubber on FH on an off- class carbon blade for almost 3 years, the inner EJ has won and I decided to try some new equipment after the end of the league season in April. Thought I'd give OSP Expert a try and put MX-S on FH and EL-S on BH. Played 3 tournaments with the new setup since then.In short, everything Dan and yogibear wrote about MX-S/EL-S in their reviews is true. Both rubbers are plenty fast even on the Expert and are very spinny. El-S in particular is a very nice rubber that is very easy to play with no matter how tired or how out of position you are. MS-S is awesome until you're about to play your 10th match on the day of the tournament and are feeling a bit tired :-)So, I decided to EJ a bit more and try something other than MX-S for my FH. Tried EL-S but it felt a bit too soft. Picked GEWO's Hype Kr and purchased a pair of sheets in max thickness in early June. Since then I practiced about twice a week on average with the new setup, and here are my thoughts on Hype Kr.Anyhow, the gory details. The first thing one noticed after opening the Hype Kr package is the booster smell. It is almost sweet and nothing like EL-S/MX-S. The tuning effect is quite noticeable when rubber is laying flat with the sponge down - the corners of the rubber curl up a bit. Visually Hype Kr looks almost the same as EL-S aside from the sponge colour. The topsheet surface and the pips feel and look identical to me. The sponge structure and bubble size seems very similar as well.Hardness-wise (under the highly unscientific finger press test) Hype Kr feels somewhere in between EL-S and MX-S.Playing impressions: Short game: Hype Kr is very similar to both ES-S (and MX-S) in the short game. Very grippy topsheet, similar spin sensitivity to EL-S.Attacking shots: This is where the boosted nature of Hype Kr shows itself. I agree with Paul - Hype Kr is a very responsive rubber, definitely faster than EL-S, with much stronger catapult, and consequentially lower arc, longer throw. I would even say it is at least as fast as MX-S on full effort shots. Most importantly, much less effort is needed to engage the catapult as compared to MX-S. Spinwise it seems to be just as spinny as EL-S on slower loops and as MX-S on faster loops with full sponge engagement.TLDR: IMHO, Hype Kr is a very interesting rubber with a lot of potential. Ideal target audience - players with good technique who need a spinny and fast rubber, with strong catapult effect, that retains the best properties of both EL-S and MX-S but is easier to play with than MX-S.I am about to play two tournaments, which ought to be a real test for the rubber. Will do a follow up afterwards."
1326,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"Thanks for the review. I feel very similar to the way that vvk1 does here. What I really like the Gewo more and more I use it is the fact that I can loop any ball very easily. Some of the people in my club were surprised at some of the balls that were coming back to them. My backhand has improved dramatically using this rubber. Blocking is also good with this rubber and it does have a longer throw so shots have to be placed or it will fly a little long.<br>Now as for the sunny7 rubber. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I would like to share a couple of things about it. First, it is very tacky similar to the hurricane 3 neo commercial or the whale 2. When bouncing the ball on my OSP Virtuoso, the ball basically dies after one bounce and gets stuck on the rubber. I felt that the throw was very low and the hardness was around 39-40, even with booster it felt harder than my hurricane 3 neo at 39 degrees. I was afraid that the ball would barely make it across the net. However, after the initial couple of hits, I could settle in and hit some massive topspins. You will definitely need to use a lot of force in order to use this rubber. I talked to the SunnySix representative via phone because I was so curious about the rubber and he told me that they were basically trying to copy the rubber that Ma Long and the Chinese National Team uses which is the Hurricane 3 blue sponge. Although I have never used the blue sponge, I have used the provincial, commercial and the nittaku hurricane 3 neo and I felt that the throw was lower than those rubbers.Blocks were fair easy especially when the opponent is hitting that ball hard as the power basically gets reflected back to them. However, you do have to put a little force behind the shot or else it will go into the net. Also, if you brush the ball too much, the ball doesn't go very far so you do have to put impact on the ball. All in all, it is perfect for people like me to like to hit very hard especially on the forehand with a lot of spin. However, if you are the type of person who wants the rubber to do some of the work for you, I don't think this is the rubber for you.As for reference, I have used various rubbers throughout my table tennis mainly hurricane 3, whale 2, tenergy 05, tenergy 64, joola express 1, tibhar el-s, el-p"
1327,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"Me too.Important point, as this is where Evolution EL-S also excels. Some rubbers have all the power for the NEXT shot, but do not offer any support on the FIRST."
1328,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,I felt that the El-S doesn't offer as much catapult compared to the Gewo so I prefer it a little more than the El-S
1329,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,Anyone can compare it to the MX-P?
1330,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"I don't have a sheet of MX-P handy at the moment, but I used to play with it when it just came out. One thing I can definitely remember is the quite noticeable shrinkage of MX-P once the booster airs out. Whereas after a month of use and a couple of re-gluings, Hype Kr has not shrunk at all."
1331,5f68775b64fe8d59b1ff54c8,SUNNYSIX rubbers / GEWO Hype KR Pro(Yoo Nam Kyu) / ITC with Ryu Seung Min,"Sponge hardness is identical, but the topsheet is softer. Easier to play on opening shots, same power in open game."

Decided to keep using it till the end of the 2017/2018 season (or till it dies)."

I really like the DHS skyline 3-60, but there's not much like it. Donic, Xiom, Butterfly, Thibar....all produce excellent bh rubbers imo. I slightly lean towards butterfly and dhs, but for FH it has to be what you can control and spin the most with. I hate butterfly for the pricing. Glad Thibar and xiom can compete and lower prices."

And the provincials are so close to the same everytime that unless you have the feeling of a Chinese national player....you won't feel the difference.Provincials are rarely faked. In fact I have never seen a fake provincial. You can call up DHS and request a box of provincials. I have done it for a ping pong shop around here. They are more expensive yes....but they aren't reserved for the national team.There IS a difference between the blue sponge and the orange. The blue sponge sucks in booster faster because it is slightly softer. However it also let's go of the booster faster....so if you are pro and change your rubber every week during training and for every tournament match, then blue sponge is for you! Orange sponge is harder but comes in softer variants (all the way down to 35 deg) hence why many women use it.The top sheet is the same.Hope that sheds some light.Here is my additional information...Chinese rubbers are meant to be boosted.

Is the only difference you've found between orange and blue how well they boost? what's the difference in playability (given the same hardness)? And is there a weight difference between blue and orange? I only really want to boost when I start playing people who can return my loops consistently, or if I need to have options away from the table. As a penholder, I play close to the table and very spinny, so don't really need the added speed. One day I'm sure I'll boost, but as for now, I'd rather focus on technique."

On taobao all sellers are shouting that sell the original. Well, try to buy rubber from taobao. On 50 seller can buy the original rubber. I at one time a lot of money and time spent to find the original seller of products. I bought at different stores and intern forums table tennis in China. Council to buy from people, although rubber will be slightly more expensive, that already have contact with the original. Greedy pays twice - this proverb.Chen Chen Rightly said that the white package is under organic rubber glue and Europe are prohibited from using the old glue.

1404,5f6877a864fe8d59b1ff54f5,Where to buy Hurricane III national blue or orange sponge?,"Prott.ccDefinitely real stuff. I have bought National and Provincial rubbers off them. A new level of playing compared to the commercial hurricane rubber.The Neo Provincial orange sponge is the most popular as it offers hardness from 37-40, and only costs $39. Therefore it can suit both FH and BH. It is definitely more powerful and spinny than the commercial version yet offers better consistency. The National version is only marginally better than the provincial version and cost like twice. But probably because my stroke is not strong enough. I have heard the National version requires better techniques and stronger stroke to unleash the power of the sponge. My clubmate as a CPen only uses the provincial version. He is at the national level in New Zealand. No offence but from what I see, provincial version is sufficient for even advanced players. Unless you have plenty of money (I regret paying $100 for the National version) or you are playing internationally, provincial version is probably enough. Sent from my ONE E1003 using Tapatalk"
1405,5f6877a864fe8d59b1ff54f5,Where to buy Hurricane III national blue or orange sponge?,"That's really annoying: some people say that provincial boosted is much better than commercial boosted, someone says just keep with commercials, because the difference isn't that big. Tell me: without considering the required slightly different technique, a provincial sheet is equal to a T05 or MX-P? I mean if I give it a first league player, he will say: yeah that's fine even if it isn't my cup of tea.? It really worth the money?"
1406,5f6877a864fe8d59b1ff54f5,Where to buy Hurricane III national blue or orange sponge?,"T05 can pair with so many types of blades and styles. In contrast hurricane rubber fits well with only blades with soft touch and some flex. Hurricane is a specialist rubber in looping, not so much in hitting or close to table offence.The provincial hurricane(authentic one) plays really wel compared to the commercial one (I have done comparison on the same blade). In terms of looping:Arc T05 higher than H3 provincialSecond bounce: H3 lower and betterSpin probably equally if H3 not betterIn terms of serve and service return, H3 is a winner hands down."
1407,5f6877a864fe8d59b1ff54f5,Where to buy Hurricane III national blue or orange sponge?,"I use H3 commercial and I learnt to play with chinese rubbers (but played with MX-P and T64 on forehand for a half year), so I know why people like H3  I wanted to know if provincial boosted is really much better than commercial boosted (I boost my H3). You also said that it's much better, so I'll replace the commercial with a provincial one. Now I have a low budget, and I will change my BH rubber first, as the H3 stay playable forever (well, until it becomes too mushy because of reboosting). Anyone else have experience with provincial?"
1408,5f6877a864fe8d59b1ff54f5,Where to buy Hurricane III national blue or orange sponge?,"To get the most out of the provincial H3:Get the real one. Fake one plays worst than commercial H3.For the new plastic balls, get the 40 degree hardness Neo version [URL]http://www.prott.vip/Product-Details.aspx?productcode=NEOH3provincialOrange/[URL], and put one two layers of booster oil. Yes boosting right from the start. When it wears off you need three layers to revive it. Boosting a 39degree sponge will make it too soft for FH.If you have the money, the BS provincial offers 41 degree hardness which will adapts better to the plastic ball."
1409,5f6877a864fe8d59b1ff54f5,Where to buy Hurricane III national blue or orange sponge?,2.1 or 2.15?
1410,5f6877a864fe8d59b1ff54f5,Where to buy Hurricane III national blue or orange sponge?,Probably no difference. I have tried 2.15.
1411,5f6877ec64fe8d59b1ff551d,How often do you change/replace your rubber?,Really depends on how much I train and also the quality on the rubber. Right now I'm playing with Airoc M and have played with the same rubber for almost a month now and Still feels good. But I have not trained as much as I usually do this month.

1413,5f6877ec64fe8d59b1ff551d,How often do you change/replace your rubber?,"I change every 2 months. When I trained in China I changed after 1 month, it depends how vigorous my training schedule is as to how worn down my rubber gets."

1417,5f6877ec64fe8d59b1ff551d,How often do you change/replace your rubber?,I normally train 5-6 times a week so I change my rubbers about every 9-10 weeksi also play in a lot of tournaments so the rubbers need changed quicker than average.
1418,5f6877ec64fe8d59b1ff551d,How often do you change/replace your rubber?,"With oil rejuvenation, I don't change until the top sheet loses spin serving or is too damaged around the edges. For an amateur, 1-3 years."
1419,5f6877ec64fe8d59b1ff551d,How often do you change/replace your rubber?,"Usually i change my forehand rubber after 4 months. Backhand lasts a bit longer, usually 6 months."
1420,5f6877ec64fe8d59b1ff551d,How often do you change/replace your rubber?,It depends on how many times 1 play with the rubbers. I used to play like 4 times a week and i changed the rubbers every 3 months but now that i only play once a week i change them every 4 - 5 months Sent from my SM-A700H using Tapatalk
1421,5f6877ec64fe8d59b1ff551d,How often do you change/replace your rubber?,"It completely depends on the player, the rubber and their activity. There really is no set time, it is really only when you feel it should be changed (which is up to your standards). A general guideline is going to be about 6 months for an active player (3+ times a week), and about once a year for a more recreational player (under 3 times a week). But it ultimately does come down to the player. Just make sure to take care of your rubber to ensure it lasts as long as possible."

1426,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,Defender as in chopper or blocker? It could be that you're not used to a fast rubber like tenergy or you're not giving it enough brushing motion
1427,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,if u cant bring the ball up with tenergy i dont know how you are gonna do it with other rubbersit's just a technique problemi cant get it in sometimes because there are hardly any defenders in tt
1428,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,"Astro S, MX-P or even rubbers from the Bluefire series or Rasant series. A more ""forgiving"" rubber then Tenergy 05?"
1429,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,"I love Astro S, for my backhand...It has a good combination of speed, spin and control. I also love M2 from the Bluefire series for my forehand. Both these rubbers are good options besides Tenergy 05 which I think is a little on the slow side compared to other rubbers."
1430,5f68780064fe8d59b1ff552a,Stiga Airoc Astro S or Tenergy 05,I don't think you need a rubber any faster than Tenergy 05 on FH unless you smack the ball and not looping it
1432,5f68783464fe8d59b1ff5549,Holy crap what chinese rubber is available in 1.7 / 1.8 similar to Tenergy 64,look for eacheng.net they also sell on ebay too.they have plenty of 15 usd chinese rubbers in diffeerent thickness
1433,5f68783464fe8d59b1ff5549,Holy crap what chinese rubber is available in 1.7 / 1.8 similar to Tenergy 64,"This rubber is very good: http://ttnpp.com/store/rubber/799-fr...-aurora-6.html. Though it comes in 2.1, it is easy to play with and feels somehow close to T64."
1434,5f68783464fe8d59b1ff5549,Holy crap what chinese rubber is available in 1.7 / 1.8 similar to Tenergy 64,"Ilia thanks for the suggestion but I already know which regular rubbers play similar to Tenergy 64, it's important the topic concentrates on 1.7, 1.9mm alternatives which is something rare as like the Aurora you listed is only available in 2.1. The Tenergy name is also not that much of a factor to be honest, it's the fact that these kids played with the 1.7 64 and we are trying to find either cheap chinese (hopefully) or european (not so cheap) 1.7mm rubber with the same throw angle, softness and tackiness. Rubbers like this that come to mind are MX-P and Rasant Powergrip, but they are not that cheap unless on sale and we want to avoid experimenting if possible. Reaper I was going to rip you a new one, I know eacheng so I didnt think what you said is useful until I decided to revisit the site, as I haven't checked it in a while. You are right they do list all the available thicknesses nicely. It's a shame I have to go through each rubber to find out which has other options than 2.2 but it's better than nothing. I'm quiet pleased with that and in a matter of fact I'm probably going to order some forehand rubbers now :P Dat friendships son! Nothing a bottle of oil can't fix. So yeah just an example I would have loved opinions on like Battle 1, a rare non tacky rubber, but there we go instantly killed by the fact its only available in MAX. So it's out of the picture. I'm aware of some cheaper euro rubbers from Donic and Joola that maybe our solution, but still I want to hear more below what people have to say as somebody may have an excellent suggestion I wasn't aware of. Thin stuff, that doesn't hang for the ball (so we assume it has to be low tack) and it's quick paced as a T64"
1435,5f68783464fe8d59b1ff5549,Holy crap what chinese rubber is available in 1.7 / 1.8 similar to Tenergy 64,"Look at Dawei. I like Dawei IQUL. It comes in 3 thicknesses ( 1.8, 2.0 and 2.2 ) and 3 level of hardness (35,40 and 42).I like IQUL 1.8mm sv ( 35t ) or reg ( 40 ) on my BH.The rubber plays well for the money.A good player can hit BH loops that skip out at the opponent. I don't believe I have tried IQUL on my FH. I have always used a DHS neo rubber on the FH when using IQUL on the BH."
1436,5f68783464fe8d59b1ff5549,Holy crap what chinese rubber is available in 1.7 / 1.8 similar to Tenergy 64,"Here is a good choice of cheap Chinese rubbers: http://colestt.com/inverted.php. Some people on this forum recommended Dawei 2008 XP, it is available in small thickness there. However, I didn't try 2008 XP.Honestly, I think that thickness doesn't matter that much."
1437,5f68783464fe8d59b1ff5549,Holy crap what chinese rubber is available in 1.7 / 1.8 similar to Tenergy 64,"Yes, one can adapt but thicker rubbers/sponges made of the same sponge will feel softer than thinner sponges.I personally would like to see DHS Neo type rubbers come in thinner sponge thicknesses."
1438,5f68783464fe8d59b1ff5549,Holy crap what chinese rubber is available in 1.7 / 1.8 similar to Tenergy 64,I start many of my students off with Dawei 2008XP in 1.8mm - the rubber is pretty heavy so it hardly makes a difference.

1441,5f68785064fe8d59b1ff5558,Boosting legal or not?,"If its VOC free and in sponge thickness range that is allowed, it is legal. If the rubber is too thick after boosting, it is illegal. It is hard for people to determine if there is boost as professionals use booster too. I don't boost myself but if i were you, i wouldn't boost. I wouldn't boost as it is unfair to other players that don't, and it makes your rubber not last longer. Booster kills your rubber but makes it really good for a short amount of time."
1442,5f68785064fe8d59b1ff5558,Boosting legal or not?,"Well, actually, I believe that boosting is against the rules regardless of whether it has VOCs or not. The factories can boost. But players are not supposed to boost. The rules don't make sense and nobody pays attention to them but boosting, regardless of what you used for boosting, is against the rules.

1443,5f68785064fe8d59b1ff5558,Boosting legal or not?,Is farting right before you do the side change illegal? Some farts can linger for minutes and can be pretty full of VOCs. Will that make the ITTF want to ENEZ my azz? What is it all coming too? First Goon Squads trying to reclaim Ur unauthorized Pro and National versions of rubbers and now this...

1446,5f68785064fe8d59b1ff5558,Boosting legal or not?,"I've got some 39 degree h3 neo. What's the optimal playing degree for this rubber? And how many layers of booster does it take to get to the optional playing degree using ""falco tempo long booster""?"
1447,5f68785064fe8d59b1ff5558,Boosting legal or not?,"I have heard that Haifu SeaMoon booster is better than Dianchi. That Dianchi booster is pretty good and both are better than Falco. But the idea of an optimal sponge hardness and an optimal amount of boost, asked as though those things are the same for everyone, is based on a simple misunderstanding of the fact that each of us are different. Our personal choices, what we like, are different. Our strokes are different. Our impact on contact is different. For you to figure out what the optimal amount of boost FOR YOU would be, you would need to do some testing. Same with the hardness of the sponge of an H3. Start testing and tell us what you find.

1448,5f68785064fe8d59b1ff5558,Boosting legal or not?,Thanks. As I got up this morning I rethought my question and you've just reinforced my morning thoughts. Lol The optional playing properties are going to be different for each person. And thanks again for letting me know that I got the bottom of the barrel booster. LolI will use it up and then try one of the better brands.
1449,5f68785064fe8d59b1ff5558,Boosting legal or not?,I think there are people on here who will tell you Falco is good. I got the info I gave about SeaMoon and Dianchi from a friend who boosts and is 2300+. He is a kid though and he is fussy about that stuff. I am sure they all work decently.

1450,5f68785064fe8d59b1ff5558,Boosting legal or not?,"Falco long boost works very well with non chinese rubbers, Haifu SeaMoon and Dianchi is stronger I think and works better on chinese rubbers."

1454,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,only babyoil

1456,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,And can the rubber stay on my bat or should it be loose
1457,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,"Ok. Haha. Sorry, now i gotcha. Many players use just baby oil or lamp oil (paraffine oil) without any other booster, 'cause the oil does the 'boosting' trick itself.Applied to the sponge in thin layers it expands the sponge. This expansion makes the topsheet stretch as well and puts the rubber under tension which therefore maximizes it's reactivity and general behaviour, so you get an increase in speed, spin and control. (As i already wrote in my first answer)"
1458,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,"Well, if you want to apply the oil to the sponge i don't know how you want to do it without taking it off the blade, so you have to take it off carefully, then apply the oil, let it rest a while and then reglue it on your blade. The process is described more detailed in the link i've posted."
1459,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,how many layers of babyoil should the sponge have and for how long to dry
1460,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,"The more baby oil you put on the more of a boost effect you get so the amount you should put on depends on the amount of boost effect you want. And as Suga D has already said, you have to take the rubbers off your racket to put the oil on the sponge. You could put a small amount of baby oil on the topsheet if the topsheet has lost its grip and that sometimes revives a bit of the grip. But putting the oil on the sponge is how you use it to expand and soften the sponge. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

1463,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,While you wait for your answer tell me is your sheet tacky? I'm thinking of trying DHS in particular and wanted to know if your rubber can pick up and hold a ball. It seems the world of DHS is full of variables. Has nobody tried the new Hurricane 8 and compared it to the older once yet?
1464,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,"yes its tacky but only the first time i could pick up the ballits dead rubber when the bold hit it, but i spins very much, so if your using your hole body its perfektmy choose rigt now is my red neo3 2,0 i fh and my black tenergy 5 1,9 i backhandit worked perfekt to training yesterdaybur remember it requires to youse the hole body in fh with neo 3"
1465,5f68789364fe8d59b1ff557d,Does babyoil/olive oil work on Hurricane neo3 without booster???,"Yeah thanks on that info, in that case it seems im already playing with something similar and maybe there is no need to try a Hurricane for this reason. The friendship transcend Im testing maybe just as tacky as the ratings claim. I just didnt like the fact that it can barely lift the ball for a second and this always seems to vary (sometimes never sometimes 2 seconds), it also doesn't stick like glue when it bounces as people show in videos. As for playing style yes I agree that it requires full body motion to execute well. It has also helped me on the short game the way it slows down when you need to. Plays excellent when boosted. Anyway that's all I wondered, if the Hurricane is better than the Friendship Transcend, in case Im missing on more spin etc. This rubber does allow me to play full swing though and people on the receiving end have already commented how much more spin there is compared to when I chicken wing it. I was surprised to hear this as I havent mentioned to them I switched rubbers."

Post your thoughts!,"Everything based on what rubber I would buy from that brand,Have tried some from Donic (Bluefire jp-01 Turbo, Jp-03, M1-Turbo), Addidas (Tenzone Ultra and P7), Xiom (Sigma 2 Euro), Butterfly's Tenergy 80 and Yasaka's Mark v ofc, so knowing that, here is my choices:Stiga: Stiga Airoc M or Calibra LTYasaka: Rakza 9 or X probably, 7 bh? (Mark V is good, but not fast enough for me)Donic: Bluefire Jp! jp-01 Turbo and Jp-03 for softer more control-bh.Xiom: I have tried Sigma 2 Euro, I wil therefore go for that.Butterfly: Tenergy 05 and 64 obv. (The hybrid 80 did not do the trick for me)Tibhar: The evolution rubers, I'd go for MX-P fh, Probably FX-P bh. (though might have ended up with EL-P, depending)Dhs: Hurricane 3 Neo (blue sponge) Andro: Probably Rasant Powergrip, but I'd might try the new Plaxon 525, bh would be either Plaxon 400 or Rasant Beat? Addidas: Tenzone Ultra for speed, P7 for slower more spin. Both are extraordinary rubbers.Haifu: tbh no idea, but I'd might have tried, Haifu Shark III (Red Sponge). Joola: Maxxx 500 or Rhyzm-P, maybe Maxxx-450 on bh. Nittaku and Victas has good rubbers too, considering Haifu is in there, they should have been too. xD"
1476,5f6878a264fe8d59b1ff5587,The best rubber/rubbers from each brand?? Post your thoughts!,"Best is such a complicated term. The original Sriver and Mark V are very good for people who are newer to practice. A lot of the top pros seem to use one of the versions of Tenergy for at least one side. Players who aren't using Tenergy on both sides are often using Hurricane 3 or pips. The term best needs a context. Best for WHAT? Sure I could go through a host of brands and list rubbers from each. But I won't. I will say that the equipment in TT is overrated and over-examined. I love doing it too because it is fun. But all the highly offensive rubbers from most of the companies are pretty darn fast and spinny. Then there are middle of the road rubbers like the Xiom Vega line that get good spin like a lot of the ""Tensor"" rubbers but have a little less spin and speed and therefore are much easier to control so in a way these are top notch for a different purpose. And then there are those rubbers that are classic rubbers from the speed glue era that played like Tenergy with speed glue but without are not fast or spinny and are great for someone just starting to play at the club level. Or should we talk about pips: Long pips, medium pips, short pips? Which one is best is the wrong question. What are each of them useful for? That is a better question. I am an offensive player. I have no problem controlling and using Tenergy, Victas, Rasant, Evolution, Rhyzm, Bluefire, H3, you name it. But those rubbers might not be as good for someone else.

1478,5f6878a564fe8d59b1ff5589,Stiga Airoc M or Tenergy 05?,"Airoc M is a bit to slow to be prefered to T05. The new Airoc Astro, supposed to be faster, might be the real deal."
1479,5f6878a564fe8d59b1ff5589,Stiga Airoc M or Tenergy 05?,"I like both Airoc M and Tenergy 05 and have played with both. I now play with Airoc M and they are a bit slower but in my opinion they are equally good for my game style. The big difference I would say is the price, like Killerspintt wrote is the new astro going to be a little faster, I will try them out pretty soon."

1496,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"I have made the mistake of believing the hype and tried both. Don't waster your money. Just get DHS H3 Neo commercial, add one layer of falco, and enjoy. There is no discernible difference between the result and DHS H3 Neo National unless you believe that blue-coloured sponge has magic properties."
1497,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"I like my Airocs which got a blue spoonge, but I highly doubt it has anything to do with the color of course. You can always try both rubbers to see for yourself but I don't think the color has something to do with how the rubbers perform. How much is the difference in price? Remember that it's often not the price that determines if the rubber is good or not. "
1498,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,at one place its about £5 but out of stock the other one is about £25 (The difference that it)
1499,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"Really, but the national version is said to be a lot quicker etc.? how well does falco work? isnt it meant to be banned now anyway"
1500,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"It is not ""a lot quicker"". Regular DHS Neo H3 commercial is perfectly playable on a 5ply allround blade like OSP Expert. One just needs not to be afraid to actually hit the ball. Some people claim that one rubber is faster/spinnier than another by 3-5%. It always makes me wonder how they measure that without investing into an expensive high-speed camera like the one used in PathfinderPro's videos on YT. Falco works quite well on many rubber sponges, not just DHS, - the chemical reaction it induces expands the sponge making it springier and a bit faster, if you feel you need the speed."
1501,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"Yh I know what you mean, if i do try the chinese rubbers i will definately just use the commercial as the national version is 6 times more expensive and only a small percentage better"
1502,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"I use the NEO commercial version. While playing against other club members who have Tenergy's and national version of Hurricane, and also boosted versions, I beat them all(Most of the time). It is not about the rubber it is about you, and your technique. They are all very good or decent players. If anything I think having those rubbers hurts them. They use it as a crutch and think that there rubber is going to win points for them and they don't play to the best of their ability with every swing, every point. Needless to say my Hurricane is also a year old, and it still works fine and I play with it every week regularly(2-4 club day). Still holds alot of spin and control even with a major loss of the tacky topsheet.TLDR; It's about your technique, doesn't matter what rubbers you have. Learn to play before worrying about rubbers and equipment."
1503,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"Have you tried the domestic versions? Do you (or anybody else) no the difference between the domestic versions and the commercial ones? (I know that the domestic versions come in different sponge hardness, I don't think this is the case for the commercial ones?)"
1504,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"I havnt personally tried the domestic versions but it says on the TTNPP website ""Domestic Version of Neo rubbers (originally for sell within China region only) provide a more detail labeling about the hardness of the rubber sponge than the oversea versions.available in 39 and 40 degree now.The only difference with the oversea version is labeling, quality of rubber are the same.""So yh i hope this helped."
1505,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,How good is the DHS Skyline TG3 Neo? how does it compare to the TG2 neo and the Hurricane 3 Neo?
1506,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,Well the thorw angle is slightly different.i found ut easier to counterloop near the table with skLine but hurr has more spin...
1507,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,Which one is faster?
1508,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"Skyline is faster,But not by much )Its about the feel of the rubber"
1509,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"The difference between Blue sponges and Orange sponges is that the blue sponge requires more power to hit ""through"" the rubber. It's also more elastic than the orange sponges. If you're able to hit through the sponge, the quality of the ball from the blue sponge will be higher than that from the orange sponge. But we're talking about world-class playing here, or nearly world-class playing. Most of the time, neo provincial hurricane is good enough. Neo Hurricanes are meant to be boosted (not trying to start any argument of whether it's legal/illegal to do so lol), so my recommendation would be a neo provincial hurricane that costs about $30? (about 180-200 RMB) and a good booster like Falco Long tempo, Seamoon, or Dianchi. As for the hardness, 39 degrees should be hard enough. Provincial male team players mostly play with 38-39 degree rubbers, while the girls play with 37-38 degrees usually. 40 is ridiculous for non pros"
1510,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"You cannot really say 'the blue sponge requires more power to hit ""through"" the rubber', and the immediately follow it with ""it's also more elastic than the orange sponge"". These statements are contradictory."
1511,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"oh sorry i meant more...springy? I'm not sure what the word is, but at low power, the orange sponge will feel more ""dead"" than the blue sponge"
1512,5f6878c364fe8d59b1ff559e,Blue Sponge or Orange Sponge,"I've only played with the H3 neo and the TG3 neo (both 39 degree). My bat is the CPEN YEO7P (offensive+) so my impression may not be entirely applicable. I find both rubbers to be excellent, with the H3 neo more forgiving towards punch-type shots and the TG3 more forgiving towards loop-type shots, if that makes sense. degree TG3 neo pretty soon. I haven't hit enough with the TG2 to draw an impression. I feel the TG3N to be better suited for penhold (due to my wrist mechanics, and I've been told I'm more of a spinner than power hitter) and H3N better suited for shakehand . I've been wanting to make a shakehand bat for myself as well, at which point i would choose H3N over the TG3N. I have noticed however that the 39 degrees rubbers require more effort and better timing further away from the table, (even on an offensive+ bat), and the effects doesn't feel quite as linear (less linear with the xuxoafa seemless poly ball). This more than likely may be due to my bat to be honest. I'm thinking about getting the 40 degree TG3N pretty soon. I fear however, that with the switch to poly balls, both the TG3N and H3N will still great, may lack just a few of the gears (but the gears are def there when playing with the celluloid balls!)."

1516,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,"Nice, I'm personally in the same situation but I've been using the Jp 01-Turbo. Not planing on changing unless I get an opertunity to try it (M1-Turbo) and finding out it's better lolz. I did in fact do some research before I came to the conclusion of buying Jp-01 Turbo instead of M1-Turbo. As far as I've understood the M1 is a litle bit faster than Jp-01 Turbo, but Jp 01 Turbo is still fast (enough).Although the throw angle (on Jp-01 Turbo) is a tiny bit lower than Tenergy (at least 80) It's still a litle higher than M1. For me the Jp-01 Turbo's throw angle is perfect. I've also read the Jp-01 is more forigiving and more smooth when it comes to strokes.(I am btw in fact using the Jp 03 on bh, soft-sponge, more control, longer dwelltime and better for my own unperfected backhand) What you could do though, is to try a M1-Turbo(fh)/jp 01 Turbo (bh) combo the next time you buy new sheets of rubber, and then test a litle back and forth. Maybe give a comperance review here, and then make your choice on rubber after a few weeks of play?

1518,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,The JP01 is definitely softer and more touchy. You can generate more speed and power with the M1 Turbo as it has firmer sponge. We have been in the stages of having our equipment expert testing the M1 turbo so hopefully we will have a video and written review prepared for it soon! 
1519,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,Awesome! Im playing with the M1 Turbo and i think it's amazing! 
1520,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,"From my experience with M2 and JP02, the M2 provides more spin and speed but the JP02 is easier to control and more forgiving."
1521,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,i´m playing the m1 Turbo on vh an jp01 Turbo on bhthe m1 Turbo is very good for hard Topspins but with less spin than with the jp01 Turboyou have great control with both Rubbersin my opinion the m1 Turbo is a bit harder and so it is very good for vh whereas with the jp01 Turbo it´s easier to produce a lot of spini really enjoy both Rubbers and won´t change in the next few months
1522,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,Nice!! I think i might that combo too next time with m1 turbo on fh and the jp01 turbo on bh :P right now i have m1 turbo max on fh and bh and its really amazing! 
1523,5f6878d264fe8d59b1ff55a8,Bluefire M1 Turbo or JP01 Turbo?,"Very Nice, I've newly bought another pair of jp 01-turbo/jp 03 (that I have not yet recieved) so could take a while, but I might try that combo the next time my rubbers are worn out again! And M1 is indeed harder, the sponge is 50* on M1 and 47,5* on Jp-01 Turbo. Dunno wether the rubber itself is harder too or not though."
1524,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??,"I haven't used Palio's Thor since I became a better player so I can't review it. Big Dipper is pretty cheap. Just get a sheet and try it out. IT's not as powerful as some other rubbers from mid distance but it at least, it has more bounce than most tacky Chinese rubber in the 38 deg sponge. That is its main selling point."
1525,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??,"About the same speed - probably slower because it is tackier, but faster on the spin end when driving."
1526,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??,Yinhe seems to me making the 38 deg much harder now. The rubber is no longer as dynamic as before.
1527,5f687901887afbc97df83850,Palio Thors or Yinhe Big dipper??,"Palio Thors is terrible. Do not buy it, i used it for a week then switched it for T05, seriously... I tried the rubber on several blades and it just didnt work for me... It is wayyyy to hard and the sponge is extremely brittle."
1529,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,Cant go wrong with either one. Just get the cheaper one lol.I would probably go for the Sriver though. Its more destructive than the Mark V.
1530,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,"You might actually be better off taking those rubbers and putting them on a slower, all wood blade for a few weeks or months before going back up to your old setup. Theoretically it should work fine either way, but that blade is fast and hard because of the carbon. If you got something like a Primorac Off- or a Petr Korbel and used it with the same rubbers for a while, once you got your touch back you can just go back to the old blade and it won't be much of an adjustment because you were using the same rubbers on a blade that is slower with more control. But if you change the rubbers to Sriver or Mark V then you will still have an adjustment for the rubbers and rubbers like Sriver or Mark V on a TB ALC is a bit weird."
1531,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,"If you got problems controlling SLOW, but very spinny Barracuda on the excellent TBS, you will have problems with Sriver too.Try a few mates' bats and discover what works for you. Switching a slow rubber to another slow rubber prolly won't solve your control issue."
1532,5f68791d887afbc97df83863,Timo Boll ALC + Mark Vs or Srivers?,Could it be possible that he's having trouble controlling the sensitivity of spin that Baracuda might have instead of the speed? It's supposed to be one of the spinniest rubbers ever and perhaps it's just reacting to everything like crazy.

1535,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Powergrip is good but doesn't last very long, I used it on my Viscaria for a month or so before I switched back to T05... If you're thinking of a rubber from the Tenergy series choose 05!!! "
1536,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"I have to agree with xVill I use Powergrip and after about six to eight weeks it feels like it's completely lost its spin capability.If you are looking for pure speed the answer is tenergy 64 however if you want a lot of speed and spin there is the tenergy 05 (these are £50 per sheet and don't last that long) have you thought about other rubbers like Donic Bluefire m1 Turbo I think this is more faster than t64 and amazing spin, lasts a lot longer and is £15 less per sheet.Personally I would research a little deeper with what really matches you as a player check out www.tabletennisdb.com/rubbers they compare all the rubbers on the market and provide links to find the best prices. Also so before buying any rubbers check out www.ttnpp.com a Hong kong distributor you can save up to 60% on the RRP and is 100% authentic.Hope this helps"
1537,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"for the powergrip your technique has to be perfect. you have to hit every single ball 98-100% correct or the ball falls straight down into the net. The rubber is also very hard, the hardest rubber Ive ever played with so you have to hit every ball on the peak of the bounce or you cant get any power.but the tenergy 64 is more foregiving and alot softer feel. so you can take the ball later or on the peak of the bounce or right after the bounce and maintaining the controll.So If you have the technique powergrip might be a good one"
1538,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"I have tried Rasant, PowerSponge, Power Grip and Grip. All of them are not even close in terms of performance when compared to their corresponding Tenergy sub products, and they last for an even shorter period of time! The Grip's top sheet does grab the new polyball abit better than the 05 does but thats all there is to it. It starts to shrink like crazy after a few weeks and now i cant even get it to cover the smallest of blades.The only thing that comes close to a Tenergy right now on overall is probably Tibhar's Evo series. At least thats what i've heard as I only had a few knocks with the FX-P and it does a pretty good job at its price."

1540,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Played with FX-P and for me its completly smashing rubber.Good choice for bh but for fh much better rubber is MX-P evolution 
1541,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"I like the Evo series and use them on FH and often Aurus, but Evo series is kinda pricy unless you see a temporary promotion."
1542,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Yea,prices are almost like tenergyes "
1543,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Verification, Andro or Butterfly Firehand? Or Andro Fibrecomb? "
1544,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,It's Butterfly Firehand Flared handle bro
1545,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Then i vote for Butterfly Tenergy 64 FX, or Friendship/729 Aurora for tightwad, and you got a pure driver blade. "
1546,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,not really the same: 37.5€ for Evo vs. 47.5€ of Tenergys.update: 26$ difference between Evo's and Tenergys on http://ttnpp.com.
1547,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Have you ever played with Aurora??I want to buy it for a long time and i always pick something else Can you send me some review or write it here  ??
1548,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"At my country:Tenergy 50 euros,and evo 40 euros so..."
1549,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Only for a knock or 2, I am afraid, so cant write any review. I remember ever try it once on a friends blade. In short, made for flats, not for spin. Block, push, drive, and smash. ;P"
1550,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"Tenergy 05 is the best if you want a Tenergy, but I prefer powergrip to 64"
1551,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Sorry if my english is not good
1552,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,"I've said it a few times already and I probably need to say it a few million times more:THERE ISNT A BEST IN EQUIPMENTS, THERE ARE ONLY THE ONES THAT SUITS THE PLAYER THE MOST.Quick example. T05 is not as good as T80 when it comes to my backhand. It gets abit too weak for my liking when I start stepping away from the table. Also its high sensitivity to spin makes it hard for me to get services back the way I want."
1553,5f687923887afbc97df83866,Rasant Powergrip or Tenergy 64,Agree they wear out so fast! Tenergy 64 is a better alternative if you got the money for it 
1554,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,why did you create the thread twice?
1555,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,I dont know how to delete one?:d
1556,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,the moderator will do that for you
1557,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,oh nice thanks.
1558,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,It really depends on your game style and your touch.
1559,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,Ok in my personal opinion me being a penholder m1 turbo is the better of the two simply because the speed and spin are on a higher bar without really loosing out on the control aspect and that was with using the donic ovtcharov senso v1 (really really fast blade) hope this helps
1560,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,"Thanks, with my blade that it is very fast too, i have a m1 so i want to know if i buy the m1 turbo it could stay uncontrolled.. well you said that the speed and spin are on a higher bar without really losing out on the control, I think that is awesome. I really tried m1 turbo but on another blade and i think that was very good about the speed, spin and loop, but i dont know how stays on my blade.Thank you for your help "
1561,5f687939887afbc97df83875,M1 or M1 Turbo?,No problem just to let you know aswell it has a life span of about 5 months then it starts to go dead.i recently bought a andro rasant powergrip and I think that it is better than m1 turbo it's faster and got very good control and not heavy.
1563,5f68793e887afbc97df83878,Oil/Grease In Bat Case...,"I had a similar experience with a newly bought Stiga case. But I was lucky, no staining in the rubber, and I was able to clean the oil by foam cleaner. However, it took about a month to get oil-free bag even with washing dishwasher detergents."
1564,5f68793e887afbc97df83878,Oil/Grease In Bat Case...,"Thats really lucky! I've tried foam cleaner and it still doesn't work. I'll be getting an exchange for my case, so hopefully the new case (still a Stiga) is better. I think I'll get some plastic sheets to protect it as well"
1565,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?,"donic baracuda,rakza 7"
1566,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?,"There are tons....H3, TG3 have tons more spin and at half to 3 times cheaper than T05"
1567,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?,There are a lot of rubbers that have equal or great spin than T05 and because many are softer they have a ton of control. It sounds more like an issue that you're trying to find something similar to T05 but want the control too. That's hard to define since we have no way of knowing which rubber density you like and what your technique and timing is like.
1568,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?,"style:fh-loopBh-controled shots but mostly loop.Density:<35deg(i prefer soft/fx rubbers).I take the ball at its peak or when descending.1 more thing-i am not concerned about money,but am not prepared to pay ridiculous prices for 1 sheet though(eg $78 for tenergy)"
1569,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?,Sir Zaidam you cant loop everything.. you have to be flexible and know diffrent spins for each type of ball. Application of diffrent type of spins for diffrent type of incoming ball. Since you are not concerned about money you can try diffrent brands of your liking ranging from a 36 degrees to 32 degree softness..Sent from my HTC One M8 using Tapatalk
1570,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?,how much to you train and do you have a coach? if you train enough and can adapt to a harder chinese rubber i would second tony's suggestion of h3/tg3 neo for your forehand.
1571,5f687954887afbc97df83887,What rubber/s has/ve more spin than T05 but less speed?,If I were you I'd go for a Donic Bluefire JP 01. It's much softer than T05 and has tons of spin. I used to play with it and I can say it is a very good rubber. The problem with H3 is that you have to tune it to get it softer while JP comes already soft.
1572,5f68795c887afbc97df8388d,Friendship/729 Aurora,i dont know
1573,5f68795c887afbc97df8388d,Friendship/729 Aurora,"I know many of 729 products are solid quality, possessing loads of spin and control. But since they are chinese rubbers, there is little tensor effect, so if you play european rubbers, be prepared to change a bit."
1574,5f68795c887afbc97df8388d,Friendship/729 Aurora,"Not bad, honestly. I used it for BH. Cheap and good but don't ever compare with tier A rubbers ya. You need to adjust a bit for BHas the trajectory a bit low."
1575,5f68795c887afbc97df8388d,Friendship/729 Aurora,"i played with friendship/729 for a long time with 729 Super FX...no problem with Friendship/729 products because they produce quality equipment also though not as good quality as the high end equipment that are available...if you take good care of it, the rubber will last long..."
1576,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"take Xiom of any kind, I don't rate tenergy it has no feeling at all I think the world just got brand crazed with it, there's so much better rubber out there."
1577,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I have to agree with pingpongpom, plus these are two very different rubbers. Xiom has bigger window, which means bigger margin of errors. And xiom accommodates best for players close to mid table.Tenergy64 on the other hand has a lower trajectory and its for players who like to attack from mid to beyond. Its closer to Stiga Boosts that I am using on my FH at the moment. It does't allow any errors and not forgiving. And I use Xiom Vega Pro for my BH."
1578,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom of course. Price is lower, spin is the same or even more, you feel the ball better than with tenergy (bigger window like someone said).I play with xiom omega 4 europe on backhand.I played with xiom vega elite on FH and switched to xiom omega 4 europe. Vega elite has less spin and is a little softer, I like the europe the best."
1579,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I prefer the Tengergy, but the Xiom rubber is'nt bad at all!"
1580,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Tengergy , 05 the best, and most Eruption players use it, but it's expensive."
1581,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?, Xiom ftw 
1582,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,of course xiom omega 4. tenergy 64 has got no control an its price is high
1583,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"T64 is the best for me... But actually, I would try some other rubbers to  for example, the STIGA Calibras or the Cornilleau Pulse rubbers are good "
1584,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,i will try the xiom sigma europe soon 
1585,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom Vega Pro! That's what I use, but I haven't tried the new Xiom family yet, maybe they are even better. But their price is getting kinda high as well I believe. But the Vega Pro is a good, durable rubber for a decent price."
1586,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,I heard that the xiom omega iv series is a very good substitute for tenergy or even better...
1587,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"i played with both. and i feel no big difference. i played with tenergy 05fx, 05 and 64. i liked the 05fx most. and i played with omega asia, europe and sigma europe. and the sigma europe is the best of all, i think "
1588,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Yea but xiom prices are definitely better than butterfly
1589,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I bought a sheet of xiom omega 4 euro - and yeah it is fast - it feels faster than all the tenergy I have tried. It has a low throw angle and doesn't grip as easily. I think it is much harder to use than any of the tenergy. It does however if you liked the euro style rubbers feel like it has the power from a distance that speed glue once gave us. If your a flatter hitter near the table it also beats the tenergy, but if you are a looper and have the money tenergy."
1590,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,I would definitely recommend using Xiom rubbers. I use Omega IV Pro on forehand and Pro Euro on the backhand and they are better than Tenergy.
1591,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I've never tried Xiom rubbers, but I will be doing so soon. As far as Tenergy 64 it's got great control if you use the right sponge for you. I've tried 1.9 and 2.1. 1.9 is what Joo uses and since he's a defender it's got fantastic control and yet is a good attacking rubber as well. 2.1 is best for someone who still wants a little bit of control on their block, but also likes to attack the service for 2nd ball attacks. Max is where everyone can lost control at, but with the right technique and practice no rubber can't be controlled. Blades are a huge issue as well. The less flexible the blade the less control you will have and thus making Tenergy or any rubber out there have less control. With Tenergy 64 I recommend anything from ALL - to OFF, but nothing above that if you don't want to lose the control of your block."
1592,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Well I'd go for Xiom, but then it really depends on what kind of player you are as to whether you suit asia, euro or pro. However IIRC Omega IV Pro is the softest?"
1593,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Speaking of Asia Pro and Europe Pro what's the difference. Can anyone verify this?
1594,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,I have been using the Xiom Omega Europe (on my spare blade) for a few weeks now and I'm not sure whether it's better then Tenergy. Nevertheless it's a worthy substitute but i'm not blown away of it's performances. I guess I'm just going to stick with Tenergy after all. Huge plus for Xiom is that it's a lot cheaper anyway. By the way anyone knows how the durability of Xiom is compared with Tenergy?
1595,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I've used Tenergy 05 and Xiom Omega III, and I found the spinniness of Omega lasted longer and overall performance was better."
1596,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I've heard good things about the Xiom family, but most loopers love tenergy once they get used to it! Its especially good for backhand looping!"
1597,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I've used Tenergy 25, 05 and 64. I liked the 05 on my backhand, but for the rest I've never been crazy about any of them. But that is probably because I compared them to speed glued rubbers :P"
1598,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Use Tenergy! i feel that it is much more better than XIOM. if u prefer bouncy rubbers try XIOM but if u prefer tensor rubbers, try Tenergy,"
1599,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,On my sheet of Omega IV it says it's a BIOS Tensor.
1600,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom omega asia is good, almost same exact feel as tenergy... Starting to think that xiom and butterfly know each others secrets .. Anyway Xiom rubber very good and less price.. on TTnPP you can get xiom sigma 2 for 35USD!!!!"
1601,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Just wondering... what Xiom would be closest to T05-FX... I'm not ready for a replacement yet, but I like to know my options as I have always considered Xiom if I didn't have the money for another sheet of Tenergy."
1602,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,If you doesn't mind about the price tenergy have their own feel but Xiom is not that specific but it's also a good one.
1603,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I feel Xiom has made great improvement these few years.Xiom imo is might better than Tenergy- much cheaper- durability is similar- more choice to suite your game/styleTenergy is realy onlt doing well, because of Butterfly's market dominant.Dominant doesn't mean good product, and that is why we can see so many brands taking business away from ""monopoly"" Tenergy.Of course, you have many people that want to use Tenergy because of Butterfly logo. So if they call it Butterfly XYZ, those people will switch to XYZ too."
1604,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom rubbers are also much lighter than the Tenergy series, at least the ones I've tried anyway.I now have a sheet of Vega Europe and Omega IV Pro on a Stradivarius blade and it is 13g lighter than what it was before- with Tenergy 05, 05fx."
1605,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Tenergy worth every penny for its performance / durability, my Xiom Sigma 2 Euro and Pro aren't bad rubbers but the durability makes me back to Tenergy."
1606,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Like to ask, how long does a Tenergy last you, vs your S2E?and how many hours per week?I feed a lot with my S2E (easily, 5 hours a week, min 5000 hits), going on for 10 months, and its starting to fade (colour) a bit, but I still feel it is powerful enough to continue using. I use Black side to feed."
1607,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I used too play with Tenergy 64 on my backhand it was great for me but after all it was a little bit expensive and then I tried Xiom Vega Pro 2,2 mm to be honest when playing I did almost feel no difference at all. but there was one downside and that is the lag of spin on the rubber. When playing a fast backhand topspin my opponents usually block it over the table but instead they blocked it into the net.Im trying Sriver G3-FX at the moment. Its great for flicking and initiate attacking with the backhand but for the second ball I feel like I have less controll than usual but I gues I still have to get used to the rubber because the sponge is softer than other rubbers I recently used.Too sad I cant play now due injury :/"
1608,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Tenergy is by far a better rubber. I have used xiom omega 3 and omega 4 for about a year and switched to t05 and t64. Tenergy gives you much better control for chopping, which, in my view, is a significant weak point of the omega series. It also returns the ball faster when blocking. When you flip with bh, you definitely get more power. The only thing is that you need some time to get used to it, especially if you are used to omega series. My impression is for omega seires, the larger your arm swing, the more spin and power you will get. However, with tenergy, you need only small, fast movement to generate power and spin. I took me about half a year to get used to it. "
1609,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Tenergy... But be careful, maybe you want to reconsider your decision since 64 are really soft, maybe 05 will be a better choice!"
1610,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"I have stayed loyal to Tenergy 05 for quite a while now, but I decided I needed a change. Did not want to go back to Tibhar's Nimbus so I decided a step in between is the best choice, so I got the Giant Dragons posted on the left.In my opinion, Tenergy is an excellent rubber for your blade but is rather expensive compared to the Xiom.I'm gonna stick with Tenergy if you have the financial means (not that it's THAT expensive, just saying).Regards"
1611,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Tenergy is best
1612,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,From these options I would go with Tenergy. If you want a cheap rubber with good speed/spin consider also Rhyzm
1613,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Let me tell you something... Yasaka Mark V... its awesome with a good fast carbon blade.. and a booster !!no comparison wat so ever ..!! 
1614,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,tenergy 64
1615,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"xiom sigma 2 it`s a good choice, one of the guys at my club replaced his sigma pro with T05 and i tell you his top spins where allot more effective with xiom than the tenergy(wierd but it`s true). I also use sigma euro 2 on my fh... ball trajectory is long but doesnt go out also the ball tends to make oponents step back to play it."
1616,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Tenergy ....
1617,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Xiom Vega Power!
1618,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,"Xiom is better for me, but you have to try to know that is my opinion"
1619,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,i will chose tenergy 
1620,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Vote Tenergy (second hand not a brand new...lol)
1621,5f687962887afbc97df83890,xiom or tenergy?,Tenergy can offer more spin
1622,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"I haven't been playing for too long, but could it possibly be that your strokes aren't getting the most out of hitting the ball? I feel like you should go with the rubber where you have more consistency/control because once you have that control and good strokes, you should be more accurate when you upgrade the rubber? I could be completely wrong too... "
1623,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,I would recommend as i have been using xiom vega europe for a while now. Its a really good rubber. I would say make about 85 percent of my shots with this rubber. Along with really spinny serves when i serve with this rubber.
1624,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"I would actually say, try Xiom Omega V Europe. It is in the same price range as Calibra, but that might be what you need. It should spin the ball a little more than Vega but it will feel similar. And you will not lose power with Omega V."
1625,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"Thanks ttlocust, shiro and UpsideDownCarl"
1626,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,And what do you think about Xiom Omega IV europe UpSideDownCarl? Because my seller don't has the omega V...
1627,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,Xiom Omega IV Europe is good. Xiom Omega V Europe is GREAT. Omega V is enough better than the other Omegas that I would tell the distributor to get it. If they can get Omega IV they can get Omega V.
1628,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"Thanks UpsideDownCarl, I will ask my seller if he don't have it because I just saw that Omega V wasn't on his website but sometimes, he has got some rubbers who are not in his website"
1629,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,I haven't played the Omega series but the softness of Vega euro and calibra lt are quite different. I reckon the vega euro to be very soft as the calibra to be in medium to hard range. How about Vega Pro? @carl could you compare Vega Pro with omega?
1630,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"Vega series is supposed to have more control but it is not as linear. It is good, but the Omegas are 1 or 2 steps up in terms of quality. Vegas are still pretty good. Pro is harder than Europe. But a Vega Pro is not as spinny or as explosive as an Omega VI Pro. Omega V Pro, has more power, more spin and is less reactive to incoming spin than Omega IV Pro. Omega V Pro has more power, speed and spin than a Vega Pro but it has as much control and is about as reactive to incoming spin. Omega V Pro is the closest Xiom gets to the quality of Tenergy. That is a really good rubber. All of them are good. But Omega V Pro is great. Not like Tenergy, but about the same level of quality."
1631,5f687963887afbc97df83891,xiom vega europe or Stiga calibra lt?,"I have tried Omega V Tour. IMO it is a very good rubber for topspins. The quality of the rubber is very nice, very consistent. It is explosive when you want it to be, but when you don't, it is very controllable. The feeling is quite unique, it feels like a Chinese rubber for touch shots like serving very close to Te net, or keeping the ball in the table, but it turns to a tensor when you give effort.

1634,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,You really mean a TEN USD rubber to better T05 and Neo H3 Provincial? I really like to know. For a cheap setup I like my YE Cpen with FH 999 Jap sponge and BH Sword Backhand II.
1635,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"Nooooooo. I mean imagine every rubber in this would only cost 10 USD (except the special pro rubbers), would you still use your Stiga Boost over T05 or NH3 or would you change your rubber? Because like I said in my opinion T05 and H3 are the best rubbers for the forehand which are ever produced. So im curious about ppl who still prefer their setup over these two rubbers even if they would be the same price (because Tenergy for example is such an expensive rubber, ppl dont want to pay for this even if they want to play with T05)."
1636,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,I see. In that case I believe T05 and Neo H3P already cover the best of both worlds. Hard to find any better I guess.
1637,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Hurricane 3 Neo National blue sponge rubber is the best on forehand if you know how to use it. It is factory boosted and doesn't need boosting. But you said National rubber dosen't count. So Still Hurricane 3 Neo prov is the the best.
1638,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"The spinnier and the best for me, are two different rubbers.The spinniest I used, I really dont know, maybe Sanwei t88-I,on loops, on serves maybe haifu BWII.The best for me is Tibhar 1Q XD on FH and Aurus soft on BH, if I could, I would join the service of BWII, the loop spin from T88-I with the speed of XD.Overall I think 1Q XD is the best i can get ."
1639,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Interesting. What does your 1Q XD better than a H3 or a T05? Im very interested.
1640,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,I don't like T05 on fh at allIt is too soft
1641,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"It's not just the rubber you have to consider, you have to consider the blade too.. And personal preference!Right now I have the perfect setup for me, but if I were to use another setup, I would probably use the Stiga Clipper Wood with Tenergy rubbers or a Michael Maze Offensive with Bluefire JP01 on both sides.. Overall, those are the three rubbers I would call the best rubber "
1642,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"just stick with DHS H3 and T05.they are the best, and there is no substitute for them."
1643,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"Both T05 and H3 Neo are very decent rubbers in the right hands.IMHO, the end result - the spin, the arc, the kick off the bounce, and speed of a shot are far less dependent on the rubber being used and are directly dependant on the technique/skill of the player using it. For example, based on my subjective observation during playing in several local leagues for a couple of years:* the spinniest slow loops are produced by two players who use T25 and Marc V respectively, both use ALL blades.* loops with the highest arc are produced by two players who use T64 and Evolution MX-P respectively, using OFF- blades* a top-20 UK junior using Rhyzm produces the fastest loops* the fastest drive loop is produced by a player using T05 FX on BTY PrimoracAs to players using T05 - there are some very good ones, but quite a few, especially in lower divisions, use it not because its properties suit their game best but simply because someone else told them it was the ""best"" rubber."
1644,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,Agree with you. I have played with T05 and T64 but still I love my Donic Vario Big Slam more than any rubber for backhand.
1645,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"too true regarding other peoples influence.Not every1 is the same,with regards to control and skill.some people go after the max versions because others said it was the best,and while doing this,they often leave out crucial training steps and methods,and often dont learn to control their game well"
1646,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"the spinniest rubber I know is thibhar ginius sound, it has a TON of spin. the downside is that the rubber is very soft so its not really the best forehand rubber. but maybe if you stick it on a very hard blade it will work out"
1647,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"I like tenergy 05 the most on my forehand, there isn't anthing better for me that I have tried. For my backhand, I also use T05, but I am sure that something else would be better. I really like the nice flicks I can give with my backhand and the very spinny loops I do when I spin when someone pushes. But I really have a hard time blcoking the ball and playing 'contra' with the backhand, just ticking the ball and controlling it, if you know what I mean. I have tried genius on my backhand, great control, but no speed and definitely not enough spin. I would really like to combine these to rubbers, does anyone have a suggestion? Maybe the H3 Neo? never heard of it before!"
1648,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?," I remember when the Haifu rubber craze was going on. In my opinion, the quality cuts of those were monstorously spinny and if I could pick any rubber it would be those. Especially when the Whale 2 Red sponge FIRST came out. The quality was outstanding, and it was so wonderful to play with. I had the 39dg. When they switched to Hard, Med, Soft, the quality went way out the window and the rubber was completely different."
1649,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"Spinniest rubber has to be Hurricane 3, it's specifically designed for heavy spin or a vicious third ball. Combination of high tackiness and very firm sponge. Softer spinny rubbers include Rakza 7 soft, Bluefire M1 which is probably marginally spinnier than Tenergy05. There are rubbers for everything nowadays and most of them are capable of producing unearthly amounts of spin and speed haha."
1650,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"Spinniest for me is Tibhar 5Q, although I believe 1Q is a better FH rubber (I use both). Another spin demon is Andro Hexer HD. I would like to try Adidas P7, I have heard it's a spin machine as well."
1651,5f687975887afbc97df8389c,Spinniest/best rubber you know?,"I agree, the Hexer HD is a beast when it comes to spin both in serves and loops. Weight is a bit on the heavy side, too heavy for me, but definitively a very spinny rubber "

1654,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,Does it sounds the same in both FH and BH?
1655,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Yes both side feel and sound the same.In my opinion, I think that during the gluing process, little thing such as:1. compressing the rubber with a roller2. the equality area of the glue3. heat (some ppl like to use the hair blower to blow it)4. ... etc...could affect the overall resultWhat do you guys think?"
1656,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Hi,seems like you have gluing issue.1. What kind of glue did you use? WBG or VOC?2. If WBG: how many layers of glue esp. on the rubber sponge? (at least 2 layers for tenergy)3. Also WBG: must wait until each layer to be completely dry before applying next layer.4. Avoid using roller esp. for tenergy series rubber.5. After gluing done, put the blade under heavy books (rd. 1kg) overnight before playing.PS: It's not recomended to use VOC glue with tenergy series rubber."
1657,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Thanks for the advise. I tried, and it worked. I reglue both the bat and the rubber 2-3 times and it reduce the vibration. The sound of it is more solid too. Really a step up. Now I am thinking if I reglue them even more... like 5-6 times, I wonder if the result would be even better?"
1658,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,What type of glue are you using? If it is a thin glue you simply need to put 3-5 layers on it. If it's more thick then you should be fine with 1 layer. It all depends on the drying process as well. People who use a hair dryer shouldn't be using the heat function only the cool/warm function.
1659,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,I am using Xiom Water Based Glue.
1660,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,Oh that works well on tensors. Do you use iseal as well? Or isafe or something like that haha.
1661,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,what is iseal or isafe?
1662,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,Sorry I meant isure. It protects your blade. That way you can never use too much glue because isure protects the blade
1663,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,Is the glue like a paste or more watery?
1664,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Is watery. Upon pressing the tip of the sponge of the glue head, the glue came out in bubble foam. But when you started to brush it on the bat and rubber, it will all become watery type."
1665,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Now, after playing for about a week, my rubber comes off. So, I re-glue it. This time, I put 3 layers. And guess what... the vibration problem is back again.Now I am really confuse. What is it that I did wrong?1. Did uneven gluing causes the vibration?2. Did I applied my glue too thick this time?3. Is it because I didn't clean my rubber enough before I reglue? (I tried to use my finger to brush off the previous glue, but it seems there are almost nothing to rub off on the rubber.)4. Did I didn't wait overnight after the regluing process?Can someone enlighten me? The vibration has really affected my play and every stroke is really uncomfortable."
1666,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,Water based glues that are non Chinese name brand are less elastic than the more pasty glues. Similar to JOOLA Xglue which is also watery I would imagine the Xiom glue needs at least 3 layers on the rubber and 1-2 on the blade. Normally if I have to use this rubber with Euro/Jap rubbers I always put 3-5 on the rubber and 1-2 on the blade.For new blades one of my resident pros recommends putting glue on first and then letting it dry and then rubbing it off. Because during the drying process or packaging process the blades can pick up micro dust particles which sort of sit in the grain of the wood and then from environment changes humid to dry or vice versa the dust can stick to the blade. So the glue helps to remove most if not all of that dust.Another important thing to mention is that you need to be sure you are spreading the glue evenly. Especially in water form many glues can spread out unevenly and cause some issues when hitting. In the case of Tenergy the spring sponge is also more porous so I definitely recommend more layers of glue to prevent issues with the ball slipping or sounding different.
1667,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Hi,1. have you taken off the old residue completely from the rubber?2. actually, for regluing, you don't need to take off the glue residue from the rubber.just put 1 thick glue on the blade, but be sure to clean the blade properly.3. Look at the glue is it still good; if you put one drop on your finger, does it still adhere properly?Every WBG has its expiry day, max. 1 year after production date.4. I have very good gluing result with these WBG: finezip, Rev. No III, Haifu WBG(need more layers, watery!).And don't forget let evey glue layer dry completely before applying new layer, and avoid using roller."
1668,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"I DID TRIED to remove the old residue from the rubber, but because my previous glue application is too little (I suppose), there is almost ""nothing"" for me to remove. I rub it with my finger, there's almost nothing coming out.You mentioned not to use roller. But should I compress it with heavy books after I attach the rubber and blade?By the way, it took me about 1 hour just to rub off every little residue from the blade (both side) with my finger. Is there an easier way?"
1669,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"What is this ""put many layers on the rubbers and blade"" talk? I just put on some glue, make sure it's spread out evenly on both rubber and blade and then put the rubbers carefully onto the blade, then I put pressure (sitting on it, or some books) on the racket. Then it's good to go and no problems have ever appeared OFC some rubbers require more glue, and also I found that I have to use more glue on a new rubber than just a regluing.. But only one layer and boom it's fine Layers of glue and all that is for speed gluing lol Sorry for my arrogance, it's not that, it's just that I wanted to tell whats working for me "
1670,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Sorry,but the OP asking for BUTTERFLY Tenergy, not that andro sh***!"
1671,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Well, there are 2 diffrent ways of regluing.1. Let the old residue, if the glue layers applied still too thin, you need only put the WBG on the blade as I've said before.2. If you've taken off the glue residue on both(blade and rubber), then you should begin the gluing process like the 1st time gluing(at least 2 layers of the rubber and 2 layers on the blade)The reason why it's better not to use the roller is: the rubber will be streched every time you use the roller.And since the rubber already factory tensioned, you have to be carefull. (otherwise the rubber shrinkage is too big!)Putting heavier books overnight does not effect the rubber performance, since the pressure is comming from above.If you having difficlties taking off the residue, than it's better to use this:http://issuu.com/butterfly.tt/docs/b...784838/6704414Page 40."
1672,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"Please, I have just started to use the so called shit.. Before I was a Tenergy lover, so you can eat your words But then again, my Andro rubbers are just as good as Tenergy, and in some areas even better in my opinion, just read my review on them if you wanna know more "
1673,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"To be honest, I have tried a lot of rubbers incl. ESN. Bisides, I had a TT-Shop and know exactly the TT-equipment quality.Andro had good products, but they were in the past.FYI: all the ESN products are almost similar, and the only Tibhar last products (Evolution series) are different.The problem with the ESN products are the error margin, they are bigger than Tenergy."
1674,5f68798c887afbc97df838ab,Gluing technique or method?,"You have clearly not played with the Rasant.. Yes, Andro had good rubbers in the past, but have struggled since the SG ban.. BUT now they are back in the game with the Rasant. Maybe it looks more like a childrens toy on the outside (package and stuff) but it's really a good tt-weapon.I've used both Tenergy and other rubbers that are supposed to be as good as Tenergy, finding only that Tenergy is the best. Until now, when I found the Rasant, that plays like a boosted Tenergy, without no booster! So in my opinion the Rasant are absolutely as good as Tenergy, or more Of course it feels a little different, but try playing with a speed glued/boosted like hell Tenergy, and then a waterbased glued Rasant, and feel the awesomeness of the green sponged Rasant "

1691,5f6879c8887afbc97df838d8,Rubber Alternatives/Options,"Here is the information I would give. After a long time of wanting this not to be the case, I have come to the conclusion that Tenergy is REALLY the best offensive rubber out there. This is the case because of a variety of reasons. It is not the spinniest rubber out there, it is not the fastest rubber out there, it is not the longest lasting. But, it is one of the fastest, spiniest and longest lasting. There is no offensive rubber that is as good at everything (except chopping) as Tenergy. However, not all players can access enough of the gears that Tenergy has to make it worth it. That being said, there are lots of rubbers to use that are more than good enough. I like the Xiom rubbers. Omega IV Pro and Europe are pretty decent. I like Sigma II Pro and Europe a little better. Those cost $45-50, something like that. But then there are a lot of good rubbers that are much less expensive. Dawei Saviga is one I used a long time ago that was inexpensive and quite good. Dawei Inspirit or Inspirit Quatro are also supposed to be decent. I think Der_Echte often recommends another Dawei rubber that is very inexpensive and pretty decent as well: Dawei 2008 XP Super Power. Those Dawei rubbers range from $7-16. You can get many sheets for the price of one Tenergy or one Sigma II rubber."

1713,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?,"Haha, first of all, make sure you don't get the rubber 'purely' because you just want to have the same playing style as Wang Hao; get the rubber that will benefit 'your' game!  And I would go with Bryce Speed FX; soft sponge which means good control for over the table gameplay (i.e. flicks) "
1714,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?,"Well said. Besides, Wang Hao never used any of these two rubbers."
1715,5f687a24887afbc97df83917,RPB Rubber- DHS TinARC 3 or Butterfly Bryce Speed FX?,"You shouldn't look for a rubber than can do flicks, topspins, loops, and whatever you're looking for. If you're trying to find a rubber that can do all of that you're looking for the wrong attributes. Your technique is much more important than any rubber. Wang Hao uses' Sriver EL with a bryce sponge because that's what he prefers. His technique however allows whatever rubber he uses to perform those strokes. He can adjust to any rubber and produce the strokes you're looking for.So I would suggest first figuring out where you need to adjust your technique before searching for a perfect rubber. You want a softer rubber to be able to control the ball and produce spin, but later when your strokes are perfected you can adjust to just about any rubber you want and you just have to look for attributes such as spin, throw angle, and speed.But to answer your question, Bryce FX and Tin Arc both work on the backhand, but for what you're looking for Tin Arc is probably your best bet."

1730,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,"You are right  Tackiness and stickiness is the same.Tacky and grippy is two different thing.Tacky means that the topsheet is sticky and slows down the ball unless power is used.Grippy rubbers in the other hand needs to 'wrap' the ball to grip it and propel it forward, usually grippy rubbers are more bouncy compared to its chinese counterparts. This is called catapult.Sponge density (hardness) also play a big role here.H3 sponge is rather hard because it needs to compensate the slowness the tackiness bring while Jap/Euro rubber needs rather softer sponge to make sure that the rubber grip the ball enough.Maybe Tin Arc 3 has both characteristics of both tacky chinese topsheet and soft japanese sponge, pretty much like Tibhar Legend Thats what I know  Hope it helps!"

1733,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,"Good info Yosua. Tacky rubber spins the ball from the topsheet's tackiness (topsheet or tacky spin), and softer grippy rubber uses mechanical spin (when the ball sinks in so that there is more surface area of the topsheet in contact with the ball). In general, tacky spin is better for serves, short game and close to the table where you cannot take as big a swing, and mechanical spin is better when you are further back and can take a bigger swing. Mechanical spin is also better for a backhand loop then tacky spin which is why the Chinese National Team for the most part uses DHS rubber (Hurricane III NEO or Skyline III NEO on the forehand) and Butterfly Tenergy (05 or 64) on the backhand."

1740,5f687a5d887afbc97df8393e,tackiness/stickiness,"Good explanation Yosua! In addition I tried both rubbers... In a comparison with the Hurricane 3, the Tin Arc 3 isn't that tacky at all. It has spring sponge technology as T05, but isn't as fast or spinny. I think is a fact that both Tin Arc's are made in China, but in May-June the Gold Arc and Gold Arc 3 are hitting stores. What rumor says, Gold Arc is made in China and Gold Arc 3 in Japan. Perhaps the Gold Arc 3 is going to have some of the same characteristics as Tenergies  Time will show and I am definitely going to try a sheet out if I can save a buck "

We just ?exhale? on our rubbers so they get a little wet and whipe it off with your t shirt. Btw I wouldnt use the sticky things you get when you buy a new rubber. They say its better when you stick them on your rubber when you are done playing but its bull****. They become dusty and you just put it on your rubber.

1768,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?,"The cleaners actually have chemicals that cause the rubber to break down. It is not like the tt companies are doing that on purpose. It is just that, if you use any form of detergent, it causes the rubber to break down. Water on a sponge is fine and does what you need it to. Not too much water. You want the dust off and the topsheet dry as fast as possible. There are some cleaners that are designed to make the topsheet more tacky for a short time like Spin Max. Those are different but the effect does not last. They are not detergent so I do not think they break down the rubber but, they are not really needed, and the effect is very short lived and only works on Tacky type rubbers not smooth grippy Japanese or German style rubbers like Tenergy. Oils expand the rubber and so, for a few weeks they will make the topsheet more grippy. But oils do cause rubber to break down and will ultimately cause the rubber to be dead sooner. In my opinion, if the rubber is dead, then using something like oil, to get a little more use out if it is fine. Oil on the sponge makes the sponge expand and gives a mild speed glue like effect. Oil on the topsheet can make some topsheets more grippy for a few weeks. But I would not do either of these things unless the rubber is basically dead and you are trying to prolong the life of the rubber so you don't have to buy your next sheet quite as soon. Organic rubber just breaks down and deteriorates over time you cannot stop that from happening. However, things like cleaning solutions, detergents and oils can speed that process. But since oils expand the rubber, they can have an interesting effect if the rubber is already dead."
1769,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?,Most cleaners seem to reduce the life of the rubber. I thought spin max actually stripped the outer layer of the rubber off which is why it made it seem more tacky (if so it also drastically reduces the life of the rubber). Is Spin max not illegal as it changes the characteristics of the rubber?I use spit (which is basically water). Life versus effect I suppose.
1770,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?,"For training and such you really only want to use water and what not, but at tournaments a cleaner would technically help get sweat and grime off of the rubber. I recommend everyone stop buying rubber cleaners from the name brands. It doesn't matter if it's in spray or foam form for it to clean all Rubber cleaners use a small percentage of window/glass cleaner and distilled water. There may be other chemicals in it, but usually that's just for it to foam up or if it's in spray form it's to keep the solution from evaporating too fast. You should just try using 10 % glass cleaner and 90 % water; distilled is the best, but any kind will do for a quick clean."
1771,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?,"I think water is good enough. I would not waste time putting glass cleaner into water when water alone does the job. The detergent in the glass cleaner would probably have some of those same chemicals that is in the cleaners from the TT companies that cause the rubber on your topsheet to break down. I think the water based Spin Max just adds a film of something that makes the topsheet a little more tacky until it is washed off. But it is true that using it would be against the rules since it will change the playing characteristics of the tophsheet, and I would not use that either. Just water. I have seen people use paper towels, I have a cool sponge that I keep in a travel soap dish but that is not needed either. I just like it.

1773,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?,"I also use water at the end of my session. Most cleaners can dry out the rubber faster, making it feel more dead if they are used too often.

1776,5f687a75887afbc97df8394e,Is it bad or wrong to use rubber cleaner too much in your rubber?,"Just use a drop of dreft or other dishwashing liquid and some water to clean, if you feel the rubber has lost his grip, use a thin layer of WD40 (Google it to see what it is) and spread it out on the rubber surface evenly, let dry for about 30 min or more (repeat 2 to 3 times if necessary), your rubber will have better grip/spin again. I use this method and play 2 years with the same rubber. You can also lightly boost a rubber by using the WD40 on the sponge side (about 2 to 3 layers also), it is a lot cheaper than Bio Booster (this is just like paraffine oil = lamp oil)."

Im sorry but i cannot help you with your question as i havent tried the rubbers. I hope a member here can help you  I use to play with DHS hurricane 3 and its awesome! You can produce huge amounts of spin on any given shot and you can hit the ball hard with it.I will ask my friends to see if they can help you.Sent from my Samsung Galaxy S2 using tapatalk
1784,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),"Hey Jordan welcome and I'm sure you'll like it here. With the H3 Neo you said you seem to block or drive the ball long a lot. That is most likely a technique issue. I would suggest working on closing your angle about 30-45 degrees when you block and stay low to the table so that it's much easier to do this. I've used skyline 2 (tg2 neo) and H3 Neo and I can say they're both great rubbers. Skyline 2 has a lower throw than the H3, but is also a bit slower. They have the same amount of spin however and it depends on your style. I would suggest H3 for Shakehand and skyline 2 for penhold.The reviews on Bomb Mopha seem to be the same and I've read that they are primarily a high tension rubber that's both fast and spinny similar to the Euro rubbers. I'd say it would be too fast for you if you are a block and drive kind of player. H3 and Skyline 3 neo are great rubbers to place the ball well.All in all, I think your issue isn't the rubber. I think you just need to tweak your shot a bit with technique and practice. Give the H3 about another 1-2 months and really work on closing your angle when you drive the ball (forward and upwards).As for your backhand if you prefer to block with this I would suggest skyline 2 on the backhand and H3 on the forehand if those are the rubbers you have. Otherwise try to find something a bit faster with a medium sponge so that blocking with your backhand is easier. Some great backhand chinese rubbers are 729 Super FX, GeoSpin Tacky, Gambler Aces, Focus Snipe 2, Cream with Transcend Sponge.Hope this helps and keep on practicing."
1785,5f687a7c887afbc97df83953,Bomb Mopha or DHS H3 neo(or maybe skyline 2 tg2 neo),Thank You both so much for your help  ill just wait a little more in case someone who has played with the bomb mopha replies

1788,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Interesting Anders, and since you are using both Calibra and Boost, I'm just wondering if you may give me some insights on the these 2 rubbers, the Boosts TP and Calibra LT. I'm thinking of changing my Boosts TP (FH) to Calibra LT, not so much as to improve my game, but out of curiosity. Any views from anyone will be appreciated in fact, especially those who are very familiar with these rubbers. Thx"
1789,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Thanks!I've made a list of rubbers that I might choose. Your (azlan's) suggestion is also there.Here it goes:Xiom:- Omega IV Europe- Vega Elite- Vega ProAndro:- HexerDonic:- Acuda S2- Acuda S3- Coppa- Coppa J.O. PlatinJoola:- Brave- Express 2- Express x-plode- PhenixDHS:- Neo Skyline 2 TG2Stiga:- Boost TX- Boost TS- Magna TS IIWhich of them are the best suited?Personnaly I thought about: Backhand: Donic Acuda S3 (or maybe S2), Stiga Boost TS, Xiom Vega Pro (isn't that too fast for my not so good Backhand?)Forehand: Xiom Vega Pro, Donic Coppa J.O Platin, Joola X-Plode, Stiga Magna TS IICheers "
1790,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Thats quite an extensive selection, and I enjoyed looking through the lists. But I'm wondering if you or anyone can give me the characteristics of Calibra LT in comparison with Boosts TP & TX.....Seems that Stiga will be launching Calibra LT Spin & Calibra LT Plus soon."
1791,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Well, it's my first selection. I'm going to take some away after reading reviews and so on. Sorry azlan but I don't know these rubbers.. I hope someone here can tell us something about them "
1792,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"The Calibra LT Sound and Calibra LT has a longer trajectory so that you can stand far away from the table and still hit really fast balls with tons of spin.Boost TP = very hard spongeBoost TX = Medium hard spongeCalibra LT = Medium spongeCalibra LT Sound = Soft spongePersonally I like the TX best for the forehand because its the one with the most spin amongst the four rubbers mentioned. It also has excellent touch when serving.The Calibra LT Sound suits my backhand nice because I can do anything with it. Super offensive, defensive, block, push, flick, loop, anything.I do not know your style Azlan, so I cant say if it fits you.. But if you are about to switch from TP to a rubber that is a tad softer, start with the TX so that the change is not too big "
1793,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"After the first round of struggling with myself, I came up with these here:Donic:- Acuda S2Xiom:- Omega IV Europe- Vega ProStiga:- Boost TSJoola: I don't find many reviews from these rubbers. Maybe some of you can help me?- Brave- Express 2- Express X-Plode- PhenixAt the moment, I'm tending to:FH: Xiom Omega IV Europe or Vega Pro (and maybe Joola Express X-Plode but I don't find many reviews..)BH: Donic Acuda S2, Stiga Boost TSWhat do you think? Do you know another rubber that I didn't mention and which can suit me? Then tell me "
1794,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"You have a personal grudge with Tibhar?I play Tibhar and I love their rubbers.Nothing personal, just curious why Tibhar is excluded from your list..."
1795,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,Look into Tibhar Genius. It is fairly cheap on Amazon and I play it on both forehand and backhand. It has a slightly tacky topsheet that I can get a lot of spin on serves and its perfect for mid distance off the table loops. I used to use Tibhar Nimbus before this and Geospin tacky before that and so far this has been the best rubber I've had.
1796,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Actually, its kinda true rhydian, tibhar have some really good rubbers which are right up your alley. You should definitely try genius and nimbus along with xiom vega.Btw, thx Anders. It was very good info that you gave me. About my game, I'm all out offence. 2nd and 3rd ball attack. Anything slightly high or long, I will attack. I like playing a couple of feet away frm the table, or really far, and will try to finish the points asap. So far, my game is fine, just that I wanna try out the Calibra LTs. I have a looping BH, but my FH is sharp, keeping the ball low a couple of cm above the net, regardless how far I am from the table. I have a full swing FH, and it's always 110%... :-)"
1797,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Well I don't know much about Tibhar rubbers... That's why ^^So, you propose: Tibhar Genius and Tibhar Nimbus ? I'll take a look "
1798,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Hi ,, I have also a really offensive play style ,, i am verry happy with a tenergy 05 1.9 fot the FH ad my BH i play with a Genius , these rubber on my hinoke V is the perfect combination for a offensive playstyle ;D"
1799,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Hi,I'm also happy with my Tenergy 05 but it'^s too expensive for me, so I want to change it ^^Do you play the normal Genius? How is it? I've been looking around and got interested in the Genius + Optimum. Does anyone know something about this rubber?"
1800,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"so Rhy I can help you I play the normal Genius on my fh it is a very good rubber for loops and topspins the balljump ( i dont know the english expression, hope you understand) is very high like the tenergy 05you can get a lot of spin in your serves and topspins, a little bit less than t05 but no rubber can produce so much spin like the t05 atmthe difference between normal genius and genius +optimum: the normal genius has a higher ball jump and so it's better for topspins against backspin, the consequence is that the optimum rubber is better for counterloops (still the optimum has a high ball jump but not that high like the normal genius)besides I would test the Tibhar Aurus( never tested it but read about it in a german forum and it get amazing reviews! really)it is a topspin rubber and very good for all kinds of topspins (against backspin, block, for countertopspin)the balljump is a little bit flatter than t05 spin is very goodcomparison:balljump: Genius >= T05 > AurusSpin : T05 >= Aurus > Genius ( but with all rubbers high spin is possible)dynamic: Aurus = Genius > T05Speed : Topspin: T05 fastest Genius and Aurus very fast too (if you have the right technique you will get the most spin with T05)Hardness: Aurus>T05>Genius (Genius is medium)so the Aurus is a newer version of the genius with a lower ball jump but good for all kinds of topspins and it is very hard--> If I were you I would test the Genius and Aurus"
1801,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Thanks! The Aurus sounds really good. If I'm not mistaken, the Aurus Sound is a little bit softier than the Aurus ?Again, I proceeded through elimination of rubbers and the remaining are:Xiom:- Omega IV Europe- Vega ProDonic:- Acuda S2Joola:- X-plodeStiga:- Boost TSTibhar;- Aurus or Aurus SoundDo you know something about the durability of these rubbers?Hm, which ones should I pick...What would you propose? Which one for FH and BH?Cheers "
1802,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,Try Aurus on both side bro 
1803,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Azlan: Glad to hear I can help you  Your playing style sounds just as myself, all out offence. I would recommend the Calibra LT Sound for the backhand, because you can do almost anything you want to with this rubber. For my forehand, I like Boost TX the best, it does not have the same type of trajectory as the Calibra, but its still quiet fast and has excellent touch in the short-short game to! And of course, lots of spin :P"
1804,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"HiI just received my first Aurus Soft rubber, trying it out coming Thursday or Friday (been training 3 days in a row now and I'm exhausted  )I play Aurus Sound 2.1 on FH now and 1.9 on BH and I'm very pleased with it. I wonder how the Soft will feel compared to the 'sound' version.The cool thing about the Aurus is the price! At €36.90 it's certainly one of the cheapest European New Generation Rubbers around.For my full review on the Aurus sound, check this thread: http://www.tabletennisdaily.co.uk/fo...ew-for-you-all"
1805,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Thanks!  Yeah, I've read it! Nice review! Waiting for the review with the Aurus Soft, an interesting rubber Maybe I'll buy some rubbers instead of only two and try different things out. Only problem getting on my way, is my mother xD"
1806,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Cheers Anders, well its decided then...I'm changing to calibra LT sound (confirmed) for BH and Boosts TP/TX (haven't decided for this yet). I'll be trying out TX this weekend, on my club mate's blade. Not playing this week, since I just finished a 3day tournament over the weekend. It was a team event, 3 singles..lost in the semis 1-2, but won 3rd place overall. Thx again buddy."
1807,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Rhydian...that's a major hurdle for you, it's like getting approval from the sponsors, except it's 10 times harder. hahahaha good luck. BTW, excellent choice of rubbers. Hopefully, your blade won't act as if it was possessed anymore since she's getting new rubbers!! hehehe"
1808,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Thanks ^^ I made a pause and didn't look at my selection for a certain time. Then, when I look now or later, I'll surely find things that I don't like and so on and finally, I get the rubbers (A friend of mine told me that he is sponsered by Joola and has 50% off so maybe I'll buy Joola X-Plode anyway and two or another rubber more but lets see ^^)If someone still has ideas and can tell me something about the rubbers, please do it "
1809,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Please have this in mind :Staying with the same rubber is still a good choice (but seeing your previous set, its quite expensive and the 'mom' barrier also lol)..New rubber could mean new technique, new approach, new problems..Its good to try things out but I think borrowing from your pals to see whether it suits you is a better idea, dont forget to see the rubber attached to the rubber you try to.Good luck, God bless and have fun in your search.."
1810,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Glad to hear Azlan, good luck with your new rubbers "
1811,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"If you are still thinking about trying Nimbus I forgot about its durrability factor. It doesn't last very long, and that was pretty disappointing. I'd say within about a 4 month period I found myself having to put a lot more effort innto my shots to get the same results as when it was new and it wsa chipping around the edges like crazy. It definitely lost its ""pop"", but so far the Genius has held up phenominally, and I've had to reglue it about 4 times over the past 7 months due to aggressive pushes that caught the rubber and peeled it up (but the rubber saw no damage or chipping!)"
1812,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"Thanks! @YosuaYosan: That's why I want to change ^^ I think I'm going to buy the two Xiom rubbers. In fact, while I was in the tournament in Belgium, I asked a player if he wanted to warm up with me and he said yes. He played the Xiom rubbers I mentionned. We changed blades and it felt really good! I really liked them! (His blade was also a xiom blade but I looked up and the difference to my blade was not much).Guess who that guy was?Jang WooJin. Actually ranked 36 on the ittf ranking for the U18 Players! Damn :OWhat do you know about the durability of them?"
1813,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,"I use Xiom Vega Pro, and I have to say it's exceptional. It's a good rubber, but since I use Boost TP on my FH, it's 2 notch slower. The good thing about it is that it's very forgiving, and quite durable. You may stand far from the table, & hit a high looping topspin, and 9 times out of 10, the ball will find the table, with super top spin. Go for it!!"
1814,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,Thanks Azlan!I think I'll use Xiom Vega Pro for Forehand and Xiom Omega IV Europe for Backhand Thanks to all of you 
1815,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,Nice setup there!You could make bombs with that LOL Hope you find your new setup the most comfortable and suitable to your natural playing style !
1816,5f687a84887afbc97df83958,Rubber change or stay with the same?,I hope you will get comfortable with your new setup
1817,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,I'm pretty sure the Chinese players favour the hurricane and tenergy rubbers
1818,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,I think the tenergy rubber is over-rated hence its over-priced!!I am sure for the non-pros like us it does not show any difference if any!
1819,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,try haifu whale and shark. they are lighter than h3 neo
1820,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,"Thanks for your reply! I've used haifu whale II before, its definately heavier than H3 neo! Although I found the haifu is more powerful in speed, I prefer the H3 for its feel and spin. So I like to keep the H3 neo for f/h, but wonder what rubber would be spinny and light for the rpb side?"
1821,5f687a92887afbc97df83961,Pros' choice of Penholder f/h and RPB Rubbers,Non-tacky rubbers are better for RPB usually.The Chinese like a tacky FH rubber and a non-tacky RPB rubber.Two tacky rubbers will also make the set up a bit heavy for CPen.
