0,I'm also interested.,2
1,maybe TTD can start reviewing some sp rubbers?,2
2,I do not know if tabletennisdaily can reiview short pips.,2
3,Think they need someone that know how to play with them.,2
4,I think all three of them are considered grippy short pips so you can create some spin but there are less effect and deception.,0
5,"802 40 is not a rubber with inbuilt glue effect, think the two other are.",2
6,So the two latter is proably a bit faster?,2
7,"I also think 802 40 is hardest, or atleast feel the the most hard.",0
8,Try google and you will find alot.,2
9,Or ask at oaak tabletennis forum.,2
10,They know more about pimples than guys here.,2
11,How do you want to play and use your short pimple?,2
12,Short pimple can be pretty different.,2
13,Some good for one style and some better for another.,2
14,"I`ve used to play for several months with 802-40 2mm on 35 degree sponge heavy boosted,",2
15,Also tested Impartial XS.,2
16,Both on shackehand BH,2
17,To me impartial XS reacts too much on incoming spin and flat hits were to predictable for my oponnet.,1
18,I suppose it is ok on CPen or as Forhand rubber.,2
19,"802-40 is very balanced but still feels a litle hard on touch shots,",1
20,I suggest you to conisder Tutle Summer 3C it feels as upgraded 802-40- it is most balanced short pips i have ever tried.,1
21,"apolonia weight more, u can find between 85-90 grams",2
22,IF ZLC- 80-85,2
23,I find Apolonia is more flexy and have softer outer ply and I love it,0
24,and I think has better quality than IF ZLC too,0
25,I find something special in Apolonia and this is the best blade right now if money is not the problem,2
26,thanks Konrad.,2
27,Is the apalonia faster then the Innerforce?,2
28,Apolonia is also innerforce...,2
29,If you want to save money.I think DHS fang bo ALC or DHS H301 is a good choices for you that It is the same innerforce with different outer ply Limba for fang bo and Koto for H301.,2

31,"If you loop everything and are active in the short game with spin manipulation, Tenergy 05.",0
32,"If you block more and are a bit more passive in the short game, the more linear precision of T64 and T80 might be more to your liking.",0
33,I'm not sure about that.,2
34,I think T25FX is better than T64 for blocking and short game.,0
35,I don't know anything about the T80 though.,2
36,"Lifehack: buy T05 first, then once it wears out, buy T80, or vice versa.",2
37,This way you will learn by yourself how these rubbers play for you.,2
38,And the difference between them is not that big so you can go from one to another with a minimal adjustment.,2
39,Depend on your skill.,2
40,I like hard sponge so t05 is my favorite.,0
41,"The sponge on T05, T80, T64 and T25 is all the same.",2
42,The difference is not the sponge.,2
43,It is the pimple construction.,2
44,T64 has longer thinner pimples with more space between pimples so the pips give more and the rubber feels softer.,0
45,"T05 pimples are a little shorter, thicker, and closer together so the rubber feels harder.",0
46,But even the rubber in the topsheet is the same.,2
47,Just the pimple construction is different.,2
48,"To the OP, I would like to ask what he means by the word ""best"".",2
49,"I won't comment on T25; but T05, T80 and T64 are all great rubbers.",2
50,There are people whose game and style of play may work with one of them slightly better than the others.,2
51,But they are all really great rubbers.,2
52,There is a video that explains decently what the difference between each one is.,2
53,"Once I am able to search for it, I will post it here.",2
54,But it has been posted to the forum many times already.,2
55,That video should help you out a decent amount.,2
56,To sum the info up simply:,2
57,"1) T05: Slower, More Spin, Higher Throw Angle.",0
58,"2) T64: Faster, Less Spin, Lower Throw Angle.",0
59,3) T80: half way between T05 and T64.,2
60,"So do you want a bigger arc, more spin to spin the person off the table but a little sacrifice in speed?",2
61,Or do you want lower shots that don't come up as much and are faster.,2
62,But with an amount of spin that is easier to counter.,2
63,Or do you want to be half way in between the two extremes?,2
64,I go with slower and more spin every time.,2
65,Especially since T05 is more than fast enough.,2

69,"Most people, including Butterfly reps, discuss T25 and T25FX as rubbers that are specialized Tenergies.",2
70,"Most discussion is about T05, T64 and T80 as those are similar rubbers along a continuum.",2
71,"With the term best, I mean actually the best experience with these rubbers.",2
72,The video mentioned I was actually familiar with.,2
73,But it doesn't give much information about the touch of these series at the table.,2
74,Tabletennis is not only about spinny topspin.,2
75,For example how does each individual rubber reacts to spinny serves?,2
76,I found that t05 is very sensitive to incoming spin and spinny serves.,1
77,But T80 is less sensitive to it etc.,0
78,Verstuurd vanaf mijn SM-G900F met Tapatalk,2
79,"T25 is also a very-very good rubber, just a way different than other Tenergies and suits less people.",1
80,"T80 has a little bit more control (for me), less sensitive to spin, but T05 is spinnier.",0
81,"Yes, but that is if you are into passive returns.",2
82,"If you like to push and spin aggressively, the T05 reaction is a benefit.",1
83,It's when you try to just touch the serve without any acceleration that using T05 is a nightmare.,2
84,"And that term best is still about preference and each person will feel something slightly different is ""best"".",2
85,"Like, for me, hands down, I like T05 more than the others for forehand.",0
86,"For backhand T05, T64 and T05FX have all worked fine.",2
87,If I used it T80 may be fine as well.,2
88,"But I remember when I tried it, I didn't try for that long and was used to T05FX and didn't give it much of a chance.",2
89,The extra spin and higher throw seems to be more important to my forehand than my backhand.,2

96,"Hi all, I've used T05 for a short time 7 years ago, too hard for me, then T05fx when it arrived in the market, a bit better but still hard even ewwith the softer sponge, surely due to the pimp construction, so the hardness of the sponge change not so much the ""feeling"" for me, then I switched to T64fx which is a great one in my opinion based on my play and my strokes.",2
97,"After testing Dignics 05 on a zlc blade after the end of last season I'm back to my primorac carbon this time with T80fx, that's a better combination for me as it gives me what I was looking for, so a bit more spin and control than T64fx.",0
98,"That's clear the complete Tenergy family and now the Dignics are great rubbers, but depending on your play not all of them would fit perfectly with you.",2
99,Very strange to see a post I wrote 4 years ago being quoted out of nowhere.,2
100,Is there any particular reason you woke this old thread up?,2
101,"Yes, I was looking in the Tenergy family what's fitting the best with me.",2
102,Maybe this tread is old but what´s said is still actual.,2

104,"The more old, the more soft the blade becomes and this is why people tends to have far better feeling with old viscarias because its.........softer than new ones.",2
105,"All Black tags are ""old"" today.",2
106,Not mentionning that water based glue soften the wood also.,2
107,"Also there is a huge difference between two ZJK, just like there is between two viscarias or two TBS.",2
108,"I own two ZJK (blue dragon), one is just like my viscaria (new tag), the other is much much more powerfull, faster, larger sweet sport and to me a much better feeling also......despite being lighter than my other alc blades.....I will swtich to this one for the plastic ball maybe.",2

112,"Useful Reply, killerspintt!",2
113,Thanks,2
114,i don't know,2
115,new one must be better,2
116,"KSP gave a very lucid explanation of WHY... but the MASTER of Viscaria, the mighty BAAL has yet to weigh in.",2
117,"Yet, he might not weigh in, because he sees such a question several times a year on the several forums he is a member or a mod.",2
118,Baal has operated the Viscaria for longer than deep double digit percentage of forum members have been ALIVE.,2
119,"this is all so true, i recently in the past 8 months have bought 3 viscaria's.",2
120,all 3 from butterflyonline,2
121,first one was really powerful,2
122,second one was flexy,1
123,3rd was some where in between,2
124,also i bought a Timoboll ALC and it was so powerful and fast i didn't match what the viscaria's felt like.,2
125,anyway... i sold all my butterfly blades and switched to stiga clippers woods,2
126,"the main reason is the butterfly handles are all too small, and thin.",2
127,stiga handles are superior and the clipper has such a sweet feel and power ratio plus the weight of the clipper is what the poly ball is requiring IMHO.,0
128,"so yes.. even at the highest level maker of blades, in this case butterfly, all 3 of my viscaria's felt different and i am very critical of my equipment.",2
129,btw i play in the usa and my rating is some where around 2130 - 2180 - just if you are wondering what level i play at.,2
130,I will one day sell the Phamster on the idea of filling in his hollowed handle Clipper to upgrade it to moar Beast Mode.,2
131,"Der_Echte, I would love to see you playing with a Clipper with your modification done to it.",2
132,That would be great.,2
133,I would love to try the blade too.,2
134,"I have one Clipper I could do it to, but, it is a bit too light so it doesn't really play like a REAL Clipper.",2
135,It is only 91 grams and the one I used to have that was 95 grams was sooooo much better.,2
136,If we filled the handle on that one it would play amazing.,2
137,95 grams is a good weight for a blade.,2
138,"Then if you have a Clipper that is 95 grams and you add 10 grams to the handle so it is handle heavy and weighs 105, that would play like a beast.",2
139,I would take that joker BEYOND Beast.,2
140,"Hey, that got a ring to it.",2
141,Maybe we just made a new international standard.,2
142,Take that Joker Beyond Beast.,2
143,Let's do it.,2
144,"If I remember to toss in my wood glue into the TT bag, I can always depend on the Philly Goon Squad to quickly produce a sharp blade for me (to remove the handle).",2
145,"I can always pick up small metal pieces from the sidewalks, that could count as sustainable management and neighborhood upkeep.",2
146,I even have C clamps for clamping when gluing the handle back on.,2
147,I though that is why Carl was given two rows of teeth...,2
148,"I sometimes use a clamp, sometimes, just hold it in hand until it sets good enough then wrap grip tape over it and call it a day until it is set by the next day.",2
149,"One time in Korea, I did this mod to one of the 896 Carl tried out and I played it 1 hr after I glued it back together, I used grip tape, it might be the one with Sigma Euro and H3...",2
150,I bet leaving it clamped for a day would make it so you can glue it back perfectly and not be able to feel that it was taken apart.,2
151,You don't need that because you like grip tape on your handle.,2
152,I like having wood with no grip tape.,2

154,Wonderful post!,2
155,Yes tenergy 80 had more control but that's just a matter of getting used to your rubber and knowing how it works and yes it might be more forgiving too.,0
156,Tenergy 64 still has a lot of spin just not as much as 80 and 80 is was better with flicks,0
157,Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,2
158,So if you like to win points of the serve you probably won't be that far back so I would go with tenergy 80 besides I don't like 64 as a backhand rubber anyway for me I would use it as a forehand rubber!,2
159,Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,2
160,I would say that t80 is very fast.,1
161,Too fast for me for BH especially with OFF blade.,2
162,"I would suggest t05fx, it is softer more control and less speed, but still not slow.",0
163,"I would say, play against any noob, and you can win your point off the serve.",2
164,"But if you are going to be serious and play against people that knows how to return your serves, 3rd balls, and so on, then its more your style of play + skills/techinque + rubber.",2
165,"By the sound of the above ""wishlist"" from you, your equipment is an overkill",2
166,"The 2 rubbers you suggested is all good for serve, chopping, rallies etc.",2
167,"T80 is more suited maybe for close to the table, while T64 can go further back.",0
168,"Other than that, it is really little difference for any player that is not ranked in the top level (in the top level, a 1% difference is a matter about winning and loosing)",2
169,It is not only that.,2
170,"A lot of people like tenergy rubbers, especially those who played long time ago with Srivers boostes with a glue each training session.",2
171,The problem is that some blades which are very offensive makes the set up with tenergies not easy to control.,2
172,"What I mean is the problem with short push, service return and short spinny topspins.",2
173,"Nowadays tactics are focused on playing short only with BH side, so we can say FH rubber can be very aggresive to make powerful and spinny topspin, while BH side should be more allround to be able playing pushes etc.",2
174,"T05FX is much easier to control and if you take it with 1.9mm, it is great for everything.",0
175,I wouldn't say that T80 is good for playing close.,1
176,if you want to play close T05 if much better.,0
177,"T80 with different dimension of pips makes the ball going higher so it is much better to play further then T05, but I cannot compare it to T64 because I have never try it.",0
178,T64 has MUCH more spin than T80,0
179,why not tenergy 05 ?,2
180,So what would the best rubber be for the BH?,2
181,And is Tenergy 05 a good choice for a FH Rubber?,2
182,Thank You everyone so far for your help.,2
183,"I think, just go T05 on both sides.",2
184,Timo Boll agrees btw,2
185,As for the blade which is best suited?,2
186,"Timo boll spirit, ALC, ZLC OR ZLF",2
187,"Jak, growing in level in TT is like playing Pokémon... You gotta catch 'em all to win, so why not try 'em all and tell us what you think.",2
188,"I was going to say, start from Timo Boll All and work the way up.",2
189,"Otherwise I can always recommened the Timo Boll Spirit, since Mr Boll is using that with T05 on both sides, i'm sure Jak can end up in the world top 10 too with the exact same equipment.",2
190,"Jak, how long are you in table tennis?",2
191,Sounds to me you are looking at a way overkill equipment.,2
192,"IMO, get a 2x rubbers + 1x blade at less than a price of those blades you have in question, and I'm sure that will be better for you.",2
193,"Unless you think most expensive is the best, or fastest is the best, or spinnest is the best etc.",2
194,"FZD stated that he doesn't like fast, he prefers more control equipment.",2
195,A 16 year old wise kid I must add.,2
196,I've been playing for 3-4 years.,2
197,"I currently have a Joola K5 Fast blade with Mambo H Rubber on both sides, Which is good all-round.",2
198,I want to upgrade my set-up.,2
199,At college my mate has a Timo Ball Blade with Tenergy 05 FH AND sriver g3 BH which I Used and really enjoyed.,2
200,When i was using The sriver in seemed to be alittle to slow and didn't have much spin and the control was nice.,1
201,"But I would like a Rubber on my back hand to have more speed, spin and good control too.",2
202,Thats why I'm posting here because a certain amount of you have played with most rubbers and know which is better with which set-up ect.,2
203,It seems your step is too big.,2
204,Your current set up is quite strange.,2
205,Most of people start with allround blade and then upgrade only the rubbers to faster.,2
206,"Final change to OFF blade is only for really advanced players, when they lack of speed with allround blade and off rubbers.",2
207,If you want to change everything I would suggest to choose OFF- setup.,2
208,"For instance blade Primorac JP OFF-, very good blade or Tibhar Stratus Powerwood.",2
209,They are both OFF- blades but Tibhar is little bit faster.,0
210,"As to the rubbers if you want to choose Butterfly, you can take T05FX to your BH (you can trust me, it is the best choice from the Bty offer) and then it depends how do you play with you FH, if you play close you can take T05, if you like to play in distance you can take T80.",0
211,"You can also try the XIOM rubbers - they are a long lasting good alternative to tenergy For example, I like to have a little harder rubber on the bh - thats why I take the PRO series there, but you could also try EUROPE for softer ones...",2

311,it surprises me that Ten05 is less durable(price) and less spinny then the Baracuda.,0
312,"Yes, it is a little bit shocking since you would expect to get an extremely overpowered rubber for ~$80 a sheet but actually, Baracuda surpasses Tenergy in spin.",0
313,"However, Tenergy has a better control, and has significantly more power.",0
314,good question.,2
315,I am intersing on yours blade so i want to know too,2
316,Heavy-headed blades?,2
317,This is the first time I've heard of this.,2
318, You will be able to see the difference between 2.1 and 1.9 if you compare the bats side-by-side.,2
319,Or you can use a ruler.,2
320,Anyone ever compared the weight in a scale for Tenergy 1.9 and 2.1?,2
321,"Well, actually there is!",2
322,"Check it out, http://tabletennis-reviews.com/refer...size-database/",2
323,Nice link you got there.,2
324,Easy to search and compares all other rubbers too.,2
325,So it seems that...,2
326,Tenergy64 (2.1) = 67g to 68g,2
327,Tenergy64 (1.9) = 63g,2
328,Tenergy05(2.1) = 70g,2
329,Tenergy05(1.9) = 66g to 68g,2
330,There is about 4g different for 2.1 and 1.9 sheet uncut rubber.,2
331,"So after cutting it out, I assume, the difference would probably be 3g then.",2
332,3g for both side is equal to 6g.,2
333,I suppose 6g makes a SIGNIFICANT difference for smaller sized guy like me.,2
